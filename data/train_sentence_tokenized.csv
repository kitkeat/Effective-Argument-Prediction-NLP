0,0013cc385424,"Hi, i'm Isaac, i'm going to be writing about how this face on Mars is a natural landform or if there is life on Mars that made it."
1,0013cc385424,The story is about how NASA took a picture of Mars and a face was seen on the planet.
2,0013cc385424,"NASA doesn't know if the landform was created by life on Mars, or if it is just a natural landform."
3,9704a709b505,"On my perspective, I think that the face is a natural landform because I dont think that there is any life on Mars."
4,9704a709b505,"In these next few paragraphs, I'll be talking about how I think that is is a natural landform"
5,c22adee811b6,I think that the face is a natural landform because there is no life on Mars that we have descovered yet
6,a10d361e54e4,"If life was on Mars, we would know by now."
7,a10d361e54e4,"The reason why I think it is a natural landform because, nobody live on Mars in order to create the figure."
8,a10d361e54e4,"It says in paragraph 9, ""It's not easy to target Cydonia,"" in which he is saying that its not easy to know if it is a natural landform at this point."
9,a10d361e54e4,"In all that they're saying, its probably a natural landform."
10,db3e453ec4e2,People thought that the face was formed by alieans because they thought that there was life on Mars.
11,36a565e45db7,"though some say that life on Mars does exist, I think that there is no life on Mars."
12,fb65fe816ba3,"It says in paragraph 7, on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time."
13,fb65fe816ba3,"Michael Malin took a picture of Mars with his Orbiter Camera, that the face was a natural landform."
14,4e472e2584fa,"Everyone who thought it was made by alieans even though it wasn't, was not satisfied."
15,4e472e2584fa,I think they were not satisfied because they have thought since 1976 that it was really formed by alieans.
16,28a94d3ee425,"Though people were not satified about how the landform was a natural landform, in all, we new that alieans did not form the face."
17,28a94d3ee425,I would like to know how the landform was formed.
18,28a94d3ee425,we know now that life on Mars doesn't exist.
19,d226f06362f5,Limiting the usage of cars has personal and professional support all across the globe and yet it has yet to be embraced everywhere.
20,d226f06362f5,"Statistical proof show where it may help and real life examples of some of the effects of reducing, or getting rid of altogether, cars in one's daily life."
21,d226f06362f5,"While ""recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by"" (Source 4), is that really enough or for the right reason?"
22,d226f06362f5,"There are plenty of reasons to stop, or limit, the amount of cars being driven on the roads for every kind of person, from the hippie to the businessman, from the mom to the college student."
23,de347c859ab6,"With so many things in this world that few people agree on, this is a nice change to see in regards the removal of so many cars."
24,de347c859ab6,"Why would they all agree, one might ask."
25,de347c859ab6,"Well, there are plenty of reasons."
26,cc921c5cfda4,stress.
27,a6fcdd9110ab,It is no secret that morning traffic jams and 5'o'clock traffic is often enough to send any driver into a fit of unadulterated rage and what better way is there to prevent that than to simply not drive at all?
28,a6fcdd9110ab,"Mother and media trainer, Heidrum Walter attested to this after moving into a mostly car-less community, claiming ""when [she] had a car [she] was always tense."
29,a6fcdd9110ab,"[She's] much happier [that] way"" (Source 1)."
30,a6fcdd9110ab,"If that were not enough, businessman Carlos Arturo Plaza who participated in the Day Without Cars in Bogota, Colombia, after just a day was able to say ""it's a good oppurtunity to take away stress"" (Source 3)."
31,a6fcdd9110ab,"Just one day was enough to de-stress this man and if that does not speak wonders, one has to wonder what does."
32,a6fcdd9110ab,"The event ""[left] the streets of [Bogota] eerily devoid of traffic jams"" (Source 3), which goes to show how stressful it was everyday, with traffic jams a common occurance."
33,a6fcdd9110ab,"No one enjoys them, so why continue to suffer through them?"
34,6efd9102298b,the environment suffers greatly from the many car emissions let out on the roads.
35,d6807f31da92,"""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe ... and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States"" (Source 1)."
36,d6807f31da92,This alone should be enough to horrify anyone out of such copious amounts of car usage.
37,d6807f31da92,"If that were not enough, ""transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions"" (Source 4)."
38,d6807f31da92,"It is clear that cars are only doing more harm to this earth all humans live on and happen to only have one of, so there is no need to continue on knowing this without changing something about that."
39,d6807f31da92,"Even car-pooling could significantly reduce emissions as there would be less cars out there, which is possible through ""more flexible commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work"" (Source 4)."
40,024f3edf0cdb,", adding the last two reasons together makes for another very important factor in all of this: everyone's general health."
41,024f3edf0cdb,"Both stress and high concentrations of smog can do a toll on one's body and the reduction of cars, once again, helps to reduce this terrible down-sides to the easy transportation option"
42,cf5dc6eb65e0,"If it must be described as ""emissions ... are choking cities"" (Source 1), then why not be a bit more concerned."
43,cf5dc6eb65e0,Air pollution can affect those with pre-existing respitory issues and stress can be a deciding factor in how effient and well a person can function.
44,cf5dc6eb65e0,"Stress on the road can lead to unsafe driving and a worse performance at work, school, or any other task-oriented location that many go to with the aid of a car."
45,8df2da9994bf,It is also worth noting that cities that have embraced a no car lifestyle such as Vauban or Bogota have generally improved as a community and have given back anything the newly car-less citizens may have been missing out on through saving them time and money.
46,033845420f01,"In Vauban, ""stores are placed a walk away, on a main street, rather than in malls along some distant highway"" (Source 1)."
47,033845420f01,"This is not only much more cost-efficient, but also convienent."
48,033845420f01,"This is saving both time and money, just like in Bogota where ""parks and sports centers [] have bloomed throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" (Source 3)."
49,033845420f01,"Not only does this help individual citizens and business owners, it helps the overall economy of the city as well."
50,9fd314f638e5,Individual car use isn't bad.
51,9fd314f638e5,"Millions of individuals using cars, however, is very bad."
52,9fd314f638e5,Note the emphasis.
53,9fd314f638e5,"Even just making a concious effort to car pool, bike to work or school, use public transportation, or use some sort of alternative transportation could be enough to clear up the air of some of it's emissions, keep oneself and others happier and less stressed, save time and money, and improve their city all in one little decision."
54,9fd314f638e5,"It's just a matter of going ahead and doing it, so what is stopping anyone from going out and making that change now?"
55,9fd314f638e5,Be the change you want to see and limit your car usage now.
56,ed7e62a18bad,Should computers read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom?
57,c20937683442,"No because, why should a computer know how your feeling?"
58,4faec979a617,It wouldn't change the emotion the students feeling.
59,4faec979a617,It also wouldn't help with the students education.
60,4faec979a617,Its over all just a waste of time.
61,a44371d6abc5,The process begins when the computer puts together a 3-D digital model.
62,a44371d6abc5,There are 44 major muscles in your face that the computer has to detect.
63,a44371d6abc5,"Eckman classified six emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."
64,a44371d6abc5,"He then "" associated each with characteristic movements of facial muscles."""
65,a44371d6abc5,For example the frontalis pars lateralis muscle is above your eye which shows your surpried when it is raised.
66,a44371d6abc5,Us humans alone can identify facial expressions on peoples faces.
67,a44371d6abc5,If you look at a friend you can tell how they are feeling at that moment.
68,a44371d6abc5,Da Vinci studied human anatomy to help paint the facial muscles percisely on the Mona Lisa painting.
69,a44371d6abc5,Dr. Huangs has new computer software it stores similar info as electronic code.
70,a44371d6abc5,He thinks there could be a different type of code to the painting.
71,e9257d57eae0,When facial facial expressions a made its about muscular action units.
72,e9257d57eae0,The school computer shouldn't have to know how you are feeling.
73,e9257d57eae0,What kind of problem is that supposed to solve
74,4a1e697d6488,This idea is nothing but just a distraction for school students.
75,4a1e697d6488,It also may detect wrong facial expressions.
76,af494e4e0b4f,To conclusion computers in school shouldn't detect emotions of the students.
77,af494e4e0b4f,I have proved my point on why it shouldn't be in school.
78,af494e4e0b4f,I have given you several examples from the passage to prove this point.
79,af494e4e0b4f,It shoudn't matter if the computer knows how your feeling.
80,9d03e2bef0ff,I think that it wouldn't be valueable to have technology be able to read emotions
81,cb1efb91bfe4,the fact that its really easy for someone else to get into your phone or tablet through face reconition
82,095847b91399,"People use face reconition alot and it can be a quicker way to get into your tablets and phones or any other electronics, but people can easily crack into the electronic and take any personal infomation that they need."
83,095847b91399,"I mean electonic ability to read people's emotions is cool and all, and its a huge next step into newer tecnology for the future, but the fact that you know say you needed to be happy to get into your phone, some one else can act happy and, well unlock your phone."
84,4e7b0234ed72,In paragraph six the article talks about how they could make different ads show if you were happy or frowning.
85,4e7b0234ed72,"That could be good but if your watching, like youtube or videos and an ad shows, your going to want to keep watching your video and not the ad."
86,4e7b0234ed72,"If a person is watching a show and an ad pops up and they smile, then it shows another ad that the person didnt want to see because they wanted to keep watching thier show."
87,4e7b0234ed72,"I think people would be angry if that happen, because not a lot of people like ads"
88,235278a2c6d7,"Ads can be good for promotion of products, but i think we all know when your playing a game on your electronic device that you want to keep playing or watching and not the ad."
89,9c3b9503c9a4,"The reasons why i said that this would be unvalueable is because the reason of security,like anything could go wrong because everything in technology can be unexpected."
90,9c3b9503c9a4,thats why i chose the reasons I did.
91,ed3a833a2f49,What is that thing on Mars?
92,c2203a58aa5c,"Well, some people believe that it was something made by aliens."
93,c2203a58aa5c,I am here to prove that it was not.
94,804266501124,The thing on Mars first was photographed in 1976.
95,804266501124,It is a huge rock formation that resembles a human face.
96,804266501124,"There are shadows that give it the illusion that it has eyes, a nose, and a mouth."
97,9e0d25faca07,Some believe that it is real evidence that there is life on Mars
98,7a01d9cb379a,well it is not.
99,a5e7a6893f7f,"On April 5, 1998, the Mars Global Surveyor flew over the ""Face."""
100,a5e7a6893f7f,The new cameras snapped a photograph that was ten times sharper than the original one.
101,a5e7a6893f7f,The new image revealed that it was a natural landform.
102,0ac0ff39b989,"Some skeptics said that maybe the alien markings were hidden by the clouds,"
103,244544e584aa,but in 2001 a newer image was taken
104,effe61fb5d6e,"This image was captured on a cloudless day, so there was nothing obstructing the view."
105,effe61fb5d6e,This image also shows
106,6f286d4b669a,"that the presumed face was a landform, and not the ancient work of aliens."
107,b199e5df1815,"So, in conclusion, the famous face on Mars was a natural landform."
108,b199e5df1815,This is supported by the pictures taken in 1998 and 2001.
109,b199e5df1815,The image captured in 2001 could also possibly see other objects if there were any.
110,b199e5df1815,"So, the face not a sign of life on Mars."
111,55f4bc9b664b,"Students around the world are forgetting more and more from their past school year, due to their long summer vacation."
112,55f4bc9b664b,"Because of this, many teachers are debating whether or not they should simply give students teacher-designed projects over the summer, or let the students design the projects themselves."
113,e713e8b20cf3,summer projects should be teacher-designed
114,f1d3e589dbbe,easy plagiarism
115,b8922c113c05,teachers' knowledge on how to deisgn and grade a project.
116,96f2ff86c0f9,"When i was in the 6th grade, for fun, our teacher assigned the class to design a volcano that had to shoot up as far as possible into the air, made with paper mache, glue, and other accessible materials."
117,96f2ff86c0f9,"There wasn't much instruction on how to do the volcano, as long as we were the ones building it, and the idea/design was original."
118,96f2ff86c0f9,"Most kids' volcanoes looked pretty amateur, with varying degrees of success."
119,96f2ff86c0f9,"However, the kid whose volcano shot up the highest, was disqualified for copying his design and materials exactly from a project someone had shared on the internet."
120,96f2ff86c0f9,"If a student can plagiarize someone's work from a project loosely designed by a teacher, then even more students can plagiarize a project that ""they themselves"" designed."
121,d203548d9024,"Often times throughout middle school, my teachers would give the students each other's assignments to grade themselves."
122,d203548d9024,"And afterwards, we would see in the grade book that the grade changed because the students weren't grading the assignments the way they should have been."
123,d203548d9024,"The student grading was meant to engage the classroom, but it turned into a showcase of how students dont really know how to grade the way teachers do."
124,d203548d9024,"If students are unaware of how a project is supposed to be graded, they can not successfully design a project that tests whether or not they understand the material."
125,e55c28aa864c,"Some people may say, ""but allowing students to design their own projects will allow them to focus more on their work during the summer."""
126,9eb4c757d0c3,"Whenever I'm given a summer assignment, I know for a fact it I won't even look at the assignment until maybe about a few days before the first day of school."
127,9eb4c757d0c3,Which would lead to me rushing a lazily put together assignment and a not so good grade.
128,9eb4c757d0c3,"Giving students the opportunity to design their own assignments will lead to students rushing their projects, and justifying it by claiming that the level of quality meets the standards of their assignment."
129,03294d2fcc6a,"It is important to keep students' minds engaged over the summer break, so they don't feel completely disoriented the following school year."
130,03294d2fcc6a,I know from personal experience that the break between school years has left me disinterested in continuing to learn and work for the next school year.
131,03294d2fcc6a,"However, giving students teacher-designed assignments will stimulate their brains and keep them focused over the break."
132,a041886eec7c,Have you ever been bored in a class room such as your highschool english classes?
133,a041886eec7c,"Well do to a brand new algorithum made by Dr. Paull Eckman, creator of the FACS(Facial Action Coding System), you can finaly be exited about learning about greek and latin roots."
134,a041886eec7c,This program can detect how you are felling and in what precentages
135,9cdb031bf4c9,In the following paragraphs they will talk about if we should or should not read students faces to make the classroom experience more enjoyable.
136,94d217778be6,Well to start off the technology has decoded the Mona Lisa smile
137,c24890bd6f6a,You know they one the smile that seams somewhat omanis when you look at it.
138,c24890bd6f6a,well this program has determend that the paintings famous smile is mostly happy.
139,c24890bd6f6a,"The spcifics of the smile are as follows she's 83 precent happy, 9 precent disgusted, 6 precent fearful, and 2 precent angry."
140,c24890bd6f6a,This computer software known as the FACS looks adn all 44 major mussles and then makes a decison based on that.
141,c24890bd6f6a,How can this be helpfull to schools.
142,162b862f7128,"Now if you actualy like doing greek and latin roots in your english class you may not need this new technology, However you may not like another class like math classes"
143,7f55d719a273,If we start doing eveything on computers like all of our lessons for example we will probably need this to keep us from not falling asleep during the class.
144,5a3369aa974c,"If we do end up adopting this new software into our computers it could make us have more fun lessons and make the classes end faster, well do to preception"
145,7da6d74a7627,If the technology could be used with just a webcam then you could just look at your students face and see if they are bored or off task and make the lesson more enjoyable.
146,7da6d74a7627,We could just look at the precentages of the kids facial expressions like how they found out how the Mona Lisa's smile was mostly happy.
147,5431a13b4893,In conclution we could make our childrens classroom experiences more enjoyable.
148,5431a13b4893,Even if it is a little creepy to have a software that watches you for your whole classroom experience.
149,5431a13b4893,But it mostlikely is worth it to make shcool more enjoyable for the kids in them.
150,15f46d6913df,Do you really thing a land form could make a face ?
151,15f46d6913df,To me that seems something is very unlikely.
152,15f46d6913df,A planet that we do not look alike can make a face as a organism on earth?
153,18e84569101a,The photo isn't clearly shown as a face it just looks like a planets land form
154,a348497d43c2,It may aslo be a feture that is only unique to this palnet like the moon has thousands of craders.
155,a348497d43c2,I just feel as if Earth has all the water and green grass on it mayb Mars has these land forms instead.
156,a348497d43c2,Also it might be like how people gaze at the stars or the clouds to see if they make an object or a human face.
157,a348497d43c2,"If you look closley you can see that the

""face"" has ridges or canyon."
158,a348497d43c2,So maybe the ridegs/canyons made the land form that way
159,5983efd986b0,NASA on the other hand and says there is likelyness of a human face.
160,5983efd986b0,They also believe it is an alien artifac
161,9373ad480e79,"According to the picture they say because of the shadows it portraies eyes, nose and mouth."
162,9373ad480e79,They say that in the years that they took the picture it has developed more and more over the spands of years.
163,f1f8daa23ba7,"In conclusion the ""face'' to me is still just a land form."
164,d64021d415d7,Just because it looks as if it is something could not just be made out of a human face.
165,d64021d415d7,If they had more evidence then it would be believeable but until then my opnion is still that it is a land form.
166,218bfd96197d,Being in a car is how we transport ourselves to and from places.
167,218bfd96197d,Now what would you do if you had to give up your car.
168,218bfd96197d,"Yes, some people didnt mind giving up their cars but not everyone would be ok with this."
169,218bfd96197d,We have gotten so used to driving cars that i don't know what some people would do if they had to give up their means of transportation.
170,218bfd96197d,"Its also another factored that what if someone had to drive a long ways, it would take them even longer to get where they're going."
171,218bfd96197d,Its a very serious topic when you think of how much time one person spends in a car.
172,599e5e16e9ed,Well Paris has enforced a driving ban to help clear the air of pollution.
173,599e5e16e9ed,"""On mondays motorists with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31)."
174,599e5e16e9ed,"The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."""
175,599e5e16e9ed,"Many people, in Paris, were fined for driving on the wrong day."
176,599e5e16e9ed,"Paris wanted to do something about the smog that was surrounding their beautiful city, so they figured if there wasnt as many cars polluting the air then the smog would go away."
177,a398be97f2b7,It actually helped having cars stop driving on certain days because the smog actually cleared.
178,38a6679de2ed,"""Recent studies suggest that Americans are buying fewer cars, driving less, and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."""
179,38a6679de2ed,American has always had a thing for cars but lately that seems to be a false statement.
180,f1cc93a81a32,"In the more populated citys, people are using more bikes and less cars."
181,f1cc93a81a32,Its easier to get around a city where there are thousands of people on the streets alone.
182,1e8d962ccf47,Internet maybe a huge reason why theres less dringing because it feels like your more connected with your friends and family without actually having to go anywhere.
183,1e8d962ccf47,The need for cars in the U.S. has gone down dramadically.
184,417f54b08a30,Ever been to a place where there are no cars aloud.
185,417f54b08a30,"Well in Vauban, Germany there is a place where if you want to go there you have to give up your car."
186,417f54b08a30,"""Street parking, driveways and home garages are generally forbidden is this experimental new district on the outskirts of Freiburg."""
187,417f54b08a30,People are happier without the stress of a car says Heidrun Walter.
188,dc6acebcd4c0,This is a place for clean air and no pollution from the car fumes.
189,dc6acebcd4c0,"As of right now, this experiment seems to be running quite nicely."
190,6d9d88dcdb54,"In all actuality, how many people dont realize how long they spend of their life in a car?"
191,6d9d88dcdb54,"If one day all cars in the world were banned, how would everyone recate?"
192,6d9d88dcdb54,"Some people may want to give up their cars, some people may not want to give up their cars"
193,d4e5221d31d2,There are many sides to people giving up their cars.
194,d4e5221d31d2,Some people are truly happy and some are not.
195,d4e5221d31d2,"It may not be that bad, i mean how did people manige before cars were even invented"
196,40556d737dae,"In one acrtical, it say there is a place where no cars are aloud but it also says that that place is an experimental project."
197,40556d737dae,In the end cars are just no as popular as they used to be.
198,40556d737dae,"is that a good or bad thing, you decide."
199,268da7edc231,President Obama has done nothing to improve our society.
200,268da7edc231,"If anything, he has created the worst society this world has ever seen."
201,2afcaec42c9c,"Limiting our usage of any type of motorized vehicle, would not only decrease air pollution but it would also help with adults or children that may not exercise enough."
202,af569f0ddf09,"Also when riding in or driving a motorized vehicle, your could get into an accident."
203,af569f0ddf09,"Getting into an accident in a vehicle could have much more fatal result than you walking, jogging, or even riding a bicycle."
204,917cc7fc5ca4,"Although walking, jogging, or riding a bicycle isnt must safer than riding in a vehicle."
205,4e718381101b,"You could be walking along when a stranger may walk up out of nowhere, beat you up, and could hurt you very badly."
206,4e718381101b,They may also take your wallet/purse.
207,4e718381101b,"Depending on who the person is, you could end up with a black eye, cut or busted lip/eye, or anything miner; while if the wrong person gets ahold of you, you could end up in the hospital needing surgery, transplant of some sort, or could even loose your life."
208,a2a95e4cd114,"Also, owning a car could could put someone in debt."
209,0adaf1d049b4,Falling behind on payments could be devastating to you and your family.
210,0adaf1d049b4,"When the car company comes to reposses your vehicle, you could end up having to walk, jog, or even ride a bike."
211,826b1039775a,So whether you like it or not everything has consequences.
212,9c59442be6db,"So, in the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to indentify human emotions."
213,3f45cda4e0b0,After reading the article I really could'nt decide.
214,3f45cda4e0b0,When reading about the FACS the first thing that came to my mind was to use this technology on the faces of celeberties.
215,6ba8f4c85956,Well it's because it would be fun to do so.
216,6ba8f4c85956,In my opinion that's what it's most useful for in classrooms.
217,8a0d92309806,Sure the teacher could use this technology to teach students about how advanced the humans have become but..
218,e890c3ba9d81,Imagine being a teacher and then one day you introduce the FACS to your students.
219,e890c3ba9d81,What do you think the first thing they do would be?
220,e890c3ba9d81,I think the first thing they would do is take selfies and let the FACS analyze thier face.
221,e890c3ba9d81,Then they laugh at the results.
222,b9be259b07fa,See they are doing it for fun.
223,9732378cc532,This reminds me of disecting frogs in biology.
224,9732378cc532,"Some students think it's useful for your education while some other students think it's a waste of time, a waste of life for the frogs and that disecting them in the first place is already digusting."
225,9732378cc532,But do they do this for fun.
226,9732378cc532,NO they don't.
227,9732378cc532,They do it to learn about the oragns of the frogs and the purpose of each organ.
228,9732378cc532,But is disecting frogs valuable?
229,9732378cc532,Yes in my opinion.
230,7d71dae9cdbf,"So, no I don't think it's classroom valuable to use FACS."
231,b2dc14b0cafc,But that dosen't mean that you should not let them try it.
232,19b8004b9213,Here's what the teachers should do.
233,19b8004b9213,They show the students a picture of someones face.
234,19b8004b9213,Lets just say for example Mona Lisa.
235,19b8004b9213,The students will stare at the picture for about a minute carefully looking at every part of Mona Lisa's face.
236,19b8004b9213,"Then the students will decide Mona Lisa's emotion by rating her happiness, sadness, anger, digust or any other kind of emotions."
237,19b8004b9213,Then after that the teacher uses the FACS on Mona Lisa's face to see if the results for Mona Lisa's emotions from the technology is the same as the results from the students.
238,c154a240940d,Human vs Technology there you go.
239,4a7d11406893,"The study the ability of humans to read subatle changesin facial expressions, thast they appiled reverse correlation technique to reveal visual features that mediate understanding of emotion expressed by the face."
240,4a7d11406893,Suprising finding were that (1) the noise added to test face image had profound effect on the facail expression and (2) in most every istance the new expression was meaningful.
241,4a7d11406893,All 44 major muscles in the mode must move like human muslces.
242,4a7d11406893,"Movemment of one or more mucles is called an ""action unit"" Then Dr. Pual Eckam, creator of (FACS) Ekman has classified six basic emotions- happeniess, suprise, anger, disgust, feat and sadness."
243,4a7d11406893,"In the text it states,""The soft wear is the latest innovatiobn from Prof. Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Institiute for Advance Science at the University of

Illinois."""
244,4a7d11406893,Dr. Huag and colleague are experts at developing better ways fo humans and computers to communicate.
245,4a7d11406893,"The faical expressions for each emotion are univeral, observers Dr. Huang, even thought individuals often show varying degrees of expression (like smiling broadly)."
246,4a7d11406893,"Using video imagery, the new emotion-recqizing softwear facture these movements."
247,4a7d11406893,"The study the ability of humans to read subatle changesin facial expressions, thast they appiled reverse correlation technique to reveal visual features that mediate understanding of emotion expressed by the face."
248,4a7d11406893,The process begins whwne the computer constructs a 3-D comupter Model.
249,6d6e1d40b9b1,"The study the ability of humans to read subatle changesin facial expressions, thast they appiled reverse correlation technique to reveal visual features that mediate understanding of emotion expressed by the face."
250,6d6e1d40b9b1,Facial expression not only expresses emtions but also even help reproduce them.
251,6d6e1d40b9b1,The thought of making faces could reveal so much about the science of emotions.
252,bbd2ffd5524f,Have you ever ever been required to do a summer project that your not intreasted in?
253,bbd2ffd5524f,Certain schools in America require students to complete summer projects to ensure they are still learning over break.
254,bbd2ffd5524f,Students are often assined teacher designed projects.
255,bbd2ffd5524f,While most students complete these over summer projects many students don't due to lack of intrest in the assined topic.
256,d149f0653fd1,To improve student input schools should move towards student designed projects so students will be more intrested and and involved in the project.
257,d9f3089308c7,"While a summer project is not something most students would like to do over there break, teachers could allow there students to choose a topic or unit to base there project on."
258,199aea4ae355,Students can use this to there advantage and choose a topic they were intreasted.
259,199aea4ae355,Students could learn and still enjoy working on the project.
260,199aea4ae355,Students also have an easier time working on topics that they have knowledge on allowing them to complete there work easily.
261,199aea4ae355,Students can take advantage of being able to design there own project and choose a topic or unit that they struggled on through out the year.
262,199aea4ae355,Working on these weak points can strengthen your skills for next school year.
263,199aea4ae355,Students can go back and look at past notes and worksheets helping improve there skills in that topic.
264,6a1cca1e1142,"Students being able to design there projects could allow the student to create something they enjoy doing over the summer with friends and family, rather then students thinking of it as another teacher assined project that is boring"
265,f4416adbb49e,Instead they can create something that they think of as fun but still educates them.
266,f4416adbb49e,They could also use this project to study or learn upcoming cirriculum for next year.
267,f4416adbb49e,This would allow the student to get a head start on future units and topics.
268,7a19c3831933,"
Overall schools that require summer break projects should move towards student designed projects over teacher designed ones."
269,7a19c3831933,When students have the ability to choose from certain topics and units they can decide what is best for them.
270,7a19c3831933,Using the project to work on material that they were intrested in through out the year and want to further research and learn about or use the oppurtunity to study material that the student had trouble with over the school year so that they can be caught up for next year.
271,7a19c3831933,Furthermore students can create projects that will help them with future cirriculum for next year.
272,7a19c3831933,"In conclusion schools should use student designed projects because it allows the student to choose how they want to utilize the time for either further studying a topic, going back and reviewing areas they had trouble in or learning future topics for next school year."
273,8ce8856c5e66,"In The article ""Making The Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto how the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions"
274,5fabd9b3a221,this new technology is valuable.
275,d1c5f0d13151,The Mona lisa demonstration really intended to bring a smile to your face this while just imagine how a computer knows when you're happy or sad thats crazy.
276,d1c5f0d13151,"For example, if you smile as soon as a web ad appears on the screen another ad will follow."
277,d1c5f0d13151,Lets say that you frown the next ad will be different from the one you smiled on.
278,d1c5f0d13151,Another thing a classroom computer can know when students are becoming to be confused or bored.
279,d1c5f0d13151,How the start of the porcess is when the computer contracts a 3-D computer model of the face all of the 44 major muscles on the model must have move like human muscles.
280,d1c5f0d13151,"Eckamn has classified six emotions for example anger, surprise, fear, sadness and happiness."
281,d1c5f0d13151,Movement for more than one muscle is called a unit.
282,d1c5f0d13151,In fact us human perfrom this impressive called calculation we use it everyday.
283,d1c5f0d13151,"For example, you could tell how your friend is feeling by looking at his or her face."
284,d1c5f0d13151,most us would have trouble describing each others facial trit that makes us happy or worried.
285,d1c5f0d13151,Yet Dr. Huang observes artist like Leonardo Da Vinci he studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles to have enough convey specific type of emoitions.
286,da54c636c445,However the new technology is valuable by telling you how what are your human emotions.
287,da54c636c445,For example a classroom computer can show when a student is bored or getting confused.
288,da54c636c445,Also it can classified six different motions
289,73c183f965dd,Therefore this New technology is valuable for the students in classrooms.
290,f6c1cbd86aff,Almost every student knows the dread of going back to school.
291,f6c1cbd86aff,The easy and laid back summer fads out and suddenly it's back to the old grind.
292,f6c1cbd86aff,"The sleeping in till noon goes back to waking up at six, bathing suits get put back in the closet, and the sun tans fade."
293,f6c1cbd86aff,"Yet, almost every student can relate to the one thing that always keeps them tied to school during the summer, the dreaded summer assignment."
294,f6c1cbd86aff,"It could be a book report or a math packet, either way it burns in the back of their minds while they cannonball into pools."
295,f6c1cbd86aff,It seeps into thoughts while they try to fall asleep.
296,fe37cadc0c6b,"If teachers gave students the opportunity to discover their own work, and maybe even a passion, students work would be of a higher quality and it might actually have them excited to go back to school."
297,5ac75720d785,"When someone decidedly does not like something, you can't force them to like it, no matter how hard you try."
298,5ac75720d785,That is what it can feel like for students when teachers assign work that is not interesting to them over and over again.
299,5ac75720d785,"There is no way for every part of classwork to interest students, but teachers could make an effort to make the one assignment that no one wants to do over the summer, interesting."
300,315a20da8ef8,"When students have the ability to decide what they will study in a project, they are more excited and more willing to get the work done."
301,5d1e0a284fca,Having students choose their project will save both the teachers and students from the painful force feeding of information.
302,3726d4fd11d5,"Now, this assignment can not be a free for all, that would not be completely fair."
303,3726d4fd11d5,There may be some students who go above and beyond while some may do the bare minimum and call it done.
304,a5b52f9c901e,To avoid this scenario teachers could implement some sort of rubric or guidelines for what the student chosen project would have to include and how they will go about grading it.
305,a5b52f9c901e,This way the playing field is level and everyone has the opportunity to succeed.
306,e3354441c900,A common issue faced with summer work is the student procrastination.
307,e3354441c900,Obviously no one wants to do schoolwork on their vacation so it is common practice to put it off for as long as possible and then rush the night before.
308,e3354441c900,Even if there was three months to do it!
309,a25ac5272d77,"With a student chosen project, students may feel more inclined to do their work because working on something that interests them won't feel like such a chore."
310,66e5faf2eabb,"The end of summer is not fun for anyone involved, students and teachers alike."
311,66e5faf2eabb,Why would we want to dampen the vacation with unexciting work looming over students heads the whole time.
312,66e5faf2eabb,Students should feel excited to go back to school and be they should have something to look foward to sharing with their classes.
313,66e5faf2eabb,It is common knowledge that doing work that is uninteresting to you lowers your performance and makes the work that much more of a chore.
314,66e5faf2eabb,With student selected summer assignments we can prevent that and create a new wave of excitement about returning to school.
315,5f20ed34ee51,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", it tals about how scientest are working on new technology to overcome the chalanges of Venus and its complications."
316,7ff80a11c483,In the begining of the artical it talks abou how Venus isthe second closest planet from the sun and how it is one of the two most similar planets to Earth.
317,7ff80a11c483,Since it has similarities to Earths' size and density scientest have sentunmanded spacecrafts to Venus to investigate.
318,7ff80a11c483,Unfortunatlly no space craft has survived acording to the last two sentances of paragraph two.
319,7ff80a11c483,In the beginning of paragraph three it states how a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide engulfs Venus.
320,7ff80a11c483,The clouds on this planet are also highly currosive with sulfuric acid in them.
321,7ff80a11c483,The planets surface averages about 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric presure is 90 times greater than on Earth.
322,7ff80a11c483,This concludes that Venus has the hotest surface tempreature of any planet in our solar system.
323,7ff80a11c483,"Venus also has obsticals like erupting valcanos, earthquakes, and frequent lightning stikes on the planets surface."
324,6460c3c57613,With all these complications though scientest still are curious about this dangerous planet.
325,0859f09e1301,In the second sentance of the fourth paragraph it explains that astronomers are curious because it may have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system.
326,0859f09e1301,"The planet resembles a surface with rocky sediment and includes things such as valleys, mountains, and craters."
327,0859f09e1301,In the fifth paragraph it states that NASA is coming up with possible solutions to avoid most of these issues.
328,0859f09e1301,One of them is inventing is a small vehical that resembles a blimp floating 30 miles above Venus's landscape.
329,7a64b833e900,Now this doesn't get the scientest what they want exactly what they want
330,bc308615acee,because due to the planets atmospher light doesn't peneatrate very well making it difficult to observe ground conditions.
331,bc308615acee,It also limits the amount that you would see in pictures and vidoes of the planet.
332,bc308615acee,Many researchers are working on new inventions so macheines will last longer on the harsh planet.
333,bc308615acee,For example in the seventh paragraph NASA states that it has been working on electronics made of silicon carbon and they have even tested it a chamber concluding that it lasted in the harsh conditions for three weeks.
334,bc308615acee,"They are also recyclaling old ideas from the 1800's, they are trying to use a computor that does calculations,but theinvention uses gears and levers, meaning that it doesn't require any electricity to work."
335,927aa74c8d21,Scientest are working hard to accheve this goal to explore this harsh mystery planet.
336,927aa74c8d21,They accept the challanges that come with it and they strive to succeed not only to gain insight but to quench their curiosity that all humans have about this planet and the possibilities that it could lead to.
337,ba3f708db030,Students shouldn't have to participate in one extracurricular activity or any
338,efeb7a805421,Students have other things to do at home
339,03205305e7bd,Many students have a lot of things to do at home and they're already busy with other things.
340,03205305e7bd,Students have a lot of homework to do from different teachers.
341,03205305e7bd,"For an example students are given a lot of homework and have chores to do at home like cleaning clothes, taking care of their pets, cleaning the house or taking care of their siblings."
342,03205305e7bd,Some students are already tired from school and might not want to participate in any other activity because they have to wake up early for school and have to do school work really early even though science say that the human brain starts working correctly when it's ten in the morning so that means the human brain of a middle school might not work so well at six or seven in the gosh darn morning.
343,e0c8f73f08a4,"I disagree with the principal that every student must participate in an activity because not everyone is sporty, want to stay inside and do the yearbook or serve on the student council."
344,0d1e519f6453,Some kids just want to go home and relax a bit after doing work at school or some just want to play games to realest their stress of school.
345,5986a3e97577,I think that students don't need to participate an any sort of activity that has to do with school because people want their minds off of school and not have to worry so much about it.
346,5986a3e97577,Kids just wanna have fun out of school and don't want to do anything school related.
347,5986a3e97577,Well most kids don't want anything to do with school once they get home.
348,a9d46712d873,I think that the principal should not decided that every single gosh darn student should do an extracurricular activity.
349,e36134b9e9ac,"Have you every herd about the story "" A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves""?"
350,e36134b9e9ac,If you haven't you get to become a Seagoing Cowboy.
351,e36134b9e9ac,"You also don't just watch farm animals you can stop at places like Greece,Itay,& China on your trip."
352,9312c509fc2f,You have to try this out
353,b5812a378920,When you go and become a Seagoing Cowboy you get to live on a boat with farm animals.
354,b5812a378920,Also while on your way to your distanation you get to stop at cool places.
355,b5812a378920,"You can stop Greece,Italy,& China."
356,b5812a378920,Also even a castle.
357,b5812a378920,You get to see different cultures.
358,b5812a378920,When your fun and amazing trip comes to an end and you have to go home.
359,b5812a378920,"Where their were animals is a big and open, because they are gone now."
360,b5812a378920,"So you play sports like baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fencing, and boxing."
361,b5812a378920,Also it wastes time on the way back.
362,2fdae40d3aab,I belevie if you do go you would have one of the best time of your life.
363,9a07bfe21f26,Also keep in mind this is to help paces after World War II.
364,7fd6e0773bcf,And you get to see how this world changed from a war.
365,7fd6e0773bcf,And how people are doing in their new home that was maybe was distroed.
366,7fd6e0773bcf,And when you do help you see how the people are happy and so thankful for you help with supplies.
367,7fd6e0773bcf,So they can now live again with some comfort.
368,8c6277128522,This essay is about if drivers should or not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.
369,bc0f305560fc,I strongly feel like drivers shouldn't be able to use their cell phones while operating a vehicle because it can be dangerous for them and everyone else on the road.
370,891ea1f779cd,Using your cellphone can actually be deadly
371,7fccafa75c59,"because cell phones can cause inattention blindness while driving, you are putting yourself and others around you in danger, and placing a ban on cell phone use while driving is proven to be effective."
372,54a1880a8c04,Using your cell phone while driving is very common nowadays.
373,09c1436528db,When people use their cell phones while driving it sometimes has a negative effect.
374,09c1436528db,Cell phone usage while driving is a common occurrence in today's society.
375,09c1436528db,"Unfortunately, it often has a negative impact on drivers using phones and those surrounding them."
376,09c1436528db,"Because of the growing popularity of cellular devices in modern society, the urge for the public to use their phones frequently is severe."
377,86b011929354,"When you are using your cell phone while driving, you're doing all three types which are manual, visual, and cognitive."
378,492b86b8daf0,Manual distraction is when you are taking your hands off the wheel for even just a split second.
379,492b86b8daf0,Many deadly accidents are caused by someone bending down to simply pick up their phone that fell on the floor of the car.
380,492b86b8daf0,Many of us don't realize how distracted we are when using our cell phones until we look up from our screens.
381,492b86b8daf0,"That's when we notice that we are swerving to one side too much, speeding or slowing down, or that we are very close to the car in front of ours."
382,9bac6a121820,There is a lot of young teenagers and also adults getting into car accidents.
383,9bac6a121820,"Its because of our cellular devices, texting while driving."
384,c3bfa0bd98cc,Teens and adults spend most of their time on their cellular devices.
385,c3bfa0bd98cc,They are either on social media or texting.
386,c3bfa0bd98cc,Nobody gets on the phone anymore its all about texting now
387,b00c67691273,It is very dangerous to text while driving
388,ccb725ab9e17,"because you are putting more attention on texting then the road, and they take their eyes off the road while they are driving, which increases the chance that the driver can lose control of the car, and could get into a car accident or worse die."
389,ccb725ab9e17,Texting and driving are worse than drinking and driving
390,57632ebf19b7,"Also, it's illegal to text and drive but people still do it cause they don't think about the consequences or what could happen."
391,89084575ca31,Texting and driving is one thing you should not be doing cause a lot of things could happen and texting is not worth risking your life.
392,89084575ca31,"When you can wait to text the person back or just get on the phone using Bluetooth to the car and talk, its better than risking your life or someone else."
393,b8212dd34061,"Yes, the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable"
394,e5ae92d2ff47,so students can study and understand how the artist felt when he or she painted on the canvis.
395,3389d2d2b95a,"They could be happy, sad, surprise, angery, disgusted,and afraid."
396,a2b19fe0dd8c,"The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is a good thing, because not only students can the device but middle age people can use the device too."
397,c0df93775ef2,"paragraph 1 said ""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."
398,c0df93775ef2,""";and how we know that?"
399,c0df93775ef2,you may ask.
400,c0df93775ef2,"The FACS ""Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS"" witch was stated in paragrah 3; they said all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles and when moving of one or more muscles is called an action unit."
401,880138981a1e,"Paragraph 4 said ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal"" and that means every you move your expressions change."
402,880138981a1e,They also gave an example they said like not smiling as broadly.
403,880138981a1e,They can move and mix emotions in da vinci's masterpiece witch the Mona Lisa useing the FACS.
404,880138981a1e,Dr. Huang's new computer software cantanes similar anatomical information as electronic code.
405,eb5b82158731,"So lets say you was trying to see all of your mom's emotions in one picture,"
406,e20f767ca9de,"by useing FACS you can move rotate and mix emotions to figer out your mom emotions, and to have students and teacher do that thats cool"
407,87e885430b55,"So yes, its valuable."
408,a49c23db6764,"""Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions."""
409,a49c23db6764,-Nick D'Alto.
410,a49c23db6764,The FACS (Facial Action Coding System) is very amusing system that can read how a human is feeling.
411,a49c23db6764,The thought of a computer software being able to decipher what I'm feeling is shocking.
412,3c3b0c54835c,I believe the use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of a student in a classroom is valuable.
413,b74a11853b35,There are many reasons why I agree with the use of the FACS.
414,b74a11853b35,"For instint, technlogy would be able to identify how you feel about what you're learning,"
415,3d6c668d1896,it'll make you a more emotional person
416,db8889f0ff9f,it will help you stay on task.
417,7742d3a09234,I think the FACS has a good chance of changing the future in a possitive way.
418,1aaf01867a83,The FACS was desinged to to recognize six everyday emotions.
419,1aaf01867a83,This would be helpful when a student is confused or does not understand what the teacher is trying to teach.
420,2c8d3582a012,The system could then modify the classwork that the student is working on.
421,2c8d3582a012,With more practice the computer could then change the difficultiness of the assignment according to how the student feels.
422,2c8d3582a012,For an example lets say a gentelman is stuck on a math problem.
423,2c8d3582a012,The frustration that the gentelman is showing will be seen by the computer.
424,2c8d3582a012,The computer will then help the gentelman by modifying it or infroming the teacher where he is struggling.
425,2c8d3582a012,This will better his education and help out more when students are scared to ask for help.
426,223f88c57968,The positive effect that the FACS has on the students is another reason why it will be vaulable in classrooms.
427,b6e3d5f4bc10,"In the passage it says,"" According to Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expreess emotions, but also may even help produce them."
428,b6e3d5f4bc10,"(""Putting on a happy face"" actually works!)""."
429,b6e3d5f4bc10,This proves that it has been proven by experts that this system could help spread positive vibes.
430,b6e3d5f4bc10,"""Whoever thought that making faces could receal so much about the science of emotions!"
431,b6e3d5f4bc10,"""."
432,b2f2c65c8168,"Finally, the FACS could help identify when students are bored and are not paying attention."
433,d0faef02f15f,This will help a student pay attention and not stay behind.
434,d0faef02f15f,The solution to this would be to modify the infromation to be interesting or less difficult for a student.
435,d0faef02f15f,I assume that this would decrease the amount of missing assignments and improve grades.
436,d0faef02f15f,This will be better fro the students to gain knowledge.
437,11fba8973075,In conclusion the Facial Action Coding System should be used in classrooms for students.
438,11fba8973075,"They will help improve their interest in topics at school, help the students understand better, it will help students be more possitive, and finally is will have a big impact on all of us."
439,11fba8973075,The Facial Action Coding System would be a new way of gaining more knowledge.
440,11fba8973075,It will help students and teachers understand eachother better.
441,11fba8973075,Overall this would be a positive impact amoung us all.
442,a2db434c4ab5,How much value would come out of going to Venus?
443,a2db434c4ab5,Scientists have tried many times to study Venus.
444,a2db434c4ab5,"Unfortunatley, they've always come out as failures."
445,a2db434c4ab5,People could argue that the effort of studying Venus is useless and ineffective.
446,a2db434c4ab5,"However, scientists have little to no knowledge of how the planets in our solar system were made."
447,a2db434c4ab5,Scientists could have more knowledge of Venus if they found a way to study the planet.
448,0e5d095f7af2,The author of the article is right about the exploration of Venus being a worthy pursuit.
449,4508ca456dfa,The author of the article does mention how difficult it is to study Venus by bringing up the planet's harsh atmosphere in Paragraph 3
450,bc108d224e7f,Which further proves his point how valuable it is to study Venus.
451,0582e9b6bba1,He also points out that Venus may have been a lot like Earth a long time ago in Paragraph 4.
452,920e6b44d345,"This doesn't just further our understanding of Venus, but it may also give us more information about Earth as well."
453,13851dce0740,"In Paragraph 5, the author mentions NASA's plans on how to study Venus."
454,4a223be3f9cf,He does mention that those plans may have challenges fo their own in Paragraph 6.
455,ac0ded4b9bcc,The author pushes to try those plans out in a realistic manner.
456,ac0ded4b9bcc,"The author being realistic with the reader, makes the reader want agree with him more."
457,7c17dbb34874,"The author backs up his suggestion with great evidence, but does it in a realistic way."
458,7c17dbb34874,"He realizes how dangerous it is to study, but pushes for it by bringing up how little we know about Venus."
459,7c17dbb34874,The author's suggestion is correct and scientists need to find a way to study Venus.
460,97caf0b48e4b,New software has been developed that improves accuracy in percieving the emotions of others
461,5bfc73ad40f2,"The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom could be valuable, or it could be a waste of time, depending on how you look at it."
462,ee7e01c3ffc3,"Technology has been upgraded throughout recent decades, and most recently, technology has taken a different approach."
463,ee7e01c3ffc3,"The software is the latest innovation from Prof. Thomas Huang, in collaboration with Prof. Nicu Sebe."
464,ee7e01c3ffc3,"Dr. Huang and his colleagues are experts at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate, but is this really a better way to communicate?"
465,ee7e01c3ffc3,It comes down to the facts.
466,ee7e01c3ffc3,"The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face, and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."
467,ee7e01c3ffc3,"Everyone has different ways of expressing emotions, and not everyone feels the same emotions."
468,ee7e01c3ffc3,"Thinking that a computer could possibly detect your emotions is a bit silly, to some, and valuable to others."
469,ee7e01c3ffc3,So what makes it silly to some?
470,ee7e01c3ffc3,"You can probably tell how a friend is feeling by the look on their face, you can talk with them in person."
471,401421cde43d,"Having physical contact is very important when it comes to emotions, using a computer to detect, sounds a bit far-fetched."
472,401421cde43d,"Schools have teachers, and school counselors, so that students can talk express how they feel."
473,401421cde43d,Some people don't see why this feature could possibly be useful in a classroom.
474,f225251a6e00,"There are many issues going on in the world, much worse than trying to figure our expressions."
475,f225251a6e00,"So, why aren't we using this tchnology, and these smart people to work on something more important?"
476,f225251a6e00,"Imagine a computer that knows when you're happy or sad, what would you need it for"
477,44b6cc50a239,"Human communication is very important, using a computer to detect how you feel is simply a waste of time, in some opinions."
478,44b6cc50a239,Making faces can reveal so much about the science of emotion.
479,058f4ce3597e,"On the other hand, what could the Facial Action Coding System be useful for in classrooms?"
480,058f4ce3597e,Students may be able to use this feature in physiciatry studies
481,311d9dc7492f,Students may also use this feature in art classes to really capture what the artist was depicting in the work.
482,311d9dc7492f,"For instance, this new software was able to create percentages of Mona Lisa's emotions."
483,311d9dc7492f,"The latest innovation in computer software may be very useful for art classes, knowing how a person may be feeling in a painting may help students to depict the artists work, a bit better."
484,311d9dc7492f,"As humans, we can tell how someone may be feeling by the look on their face, or the look in their eyes."
485,311d9dc7492f,"Most of us would have trouble trying to describe what facial expressions convey being happy, besides a smile."
486,311d9dc7492f,The computer can make exact percentages on each emotion you may be feeling.
487,2953f330d3ea,"However, a computer cannot feel, cannot have sympathy, and cannot understand many things about humans."
488,0f1fbaff772e,Reaching the final conclusion is up to you.
489,0f1fbaff772e,"Is a computer being able to identify your emotions useful in classrooms, or not?"
490,ba6a9d0294ee,"Venus is a very dangrus planet its ben proven, not one human has lasted more than a few hours floating above the fray,its been more than three decades since a space ship has tuched venus but"
491,5e605734b4a7,scientist are till working on the planert wonderingthe same question as you why are we still working on this dangerus planet
492,80799deeb1b1,"well scientist come to notice that venus has some familiar featurs alike earth it has vallys, mountains,and craters, scientist have come to think that long time ago, venus was probably coverd with oceans and could have suppoted various forms of life, just like earth today., thats why scientists are not giving up on figuring out venus witch is why they are still trying to go back to venus safe and scientificly productive following the safe orders that NASA gave the scientist, NASA gave sicentist permission to go to venus with some conditions,they will only be allowed to be floating above the fry, scientist will have to invent a stronger space ship, and they will have to study not just the planet but the people more so it can be safer and they dont have any risks."
493,80799deeb1b1,"not to mention venusis the closest to earth in terms of desity and size, and occasionatly the closest to didtance too its the second planet from our sun known as erths twin."

515,4b1e4c493bfd,"to all the residents of this community are Bendz and Suburban going were all the extoic cars and muscle cars at all i see bendz and suburban, Its few foreigen cars out there in the street."
516,4b1e4c493bfd,when I riding on the highway I like to see Mustangs and And Lamborginis ride aside if me because its excited other people it make them want to buy Mustangs and Lamborginis.
517,4b1e4c493bfd,Yes Bendz are nice but i want to see some foreiegn cars Like Bugati and RoyalRoce 50% you will see foreiegn ride around in the city I like to take a trip to see al type of cars with nice paint job and nice looking skirt.
518,4b1e4c493bfd,You will not see that much cars riding around because people sell them to live in beautyful homes.
519,4b1e4c493bfd,In 2007 all the streets was full with muscle cars because the rapper Rick Ross was the first person drive a drop top mustang so many people was so excited thats i seen the whole streets with differnt type of mustangs and drop tops.

524,fcde6d8cebc6,"You may like soccer, art, or even debate."
525,fcde6d8cebc6,The possibilities are endless to any activity that you could join at your school.
526,fcde6d8cebc6,Extracurricular activities are important to every school.
527,fcde6d8cebc6,"Though every school has different activities, each and every one of them play a key role."
528,fcde6d8cebc6,Students may wonder why their principal would make them have to stay after a long day of learning.
529,fcde6d8cebc6,"Students may think that extracurricular activities aren't interesting, but they may not realize how many options their school has to offer."
530,fcde6d8cebc6,Our principal should start putting up sheets that inform you on what activities we have and a brief explanation about them.
531,2bb7cac3fac3,I agree that it should be mandatory for all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity
532,31f36b059200,they will be involved in their school
533,52b380e7af54,they will make friends
534,c0dd3728cc9f,they could enjoy it.
535,417ac9e47c2d,Students should always feel involved in their school.
536,d17b99fb8370,Every student matters and can make a difference.
537,d17b99fb8370,A good way to be involved at school is to join an extracurricular activity.
538,d17b99fb8370,"For example, if someone joined the SCA then they would be involved by organizing school dances and events."
539,d17b99fb8370,Giving ideas to the student council is another way to be a part of your school.
540,d17b99fb8370,"Say you thought that the dress code needed to be adjusted, you could join a club and talk about it."
541,d17b99fb8370,These clubs can be used to spread awareness for bullying.
542,d17b99fb8370,Someone could of been bullied and they want to feel part of something so they join a club for bullying awareness.
543,d17b99fb8370,Students should encourage others to be part of something at their school.
544,d17b99fb8370,"There are numerous ways to be involved at your school, all you need to do is put yourself out there."
545,7a114fdc93ff,"Joining an extracurricular activity is a great way to make new friends, because you get to meet people that you would of never talked to if you didn't join that club."
546,3f1155e3369a,If you are generally a shy person then a club or sports team will help you meet new people.
547,3f1155e3369a,"For instance, if you get on a sports team you and your team will become one big family."
548,3f1155e3369a,You all will work together during games which will create a bond.
549,3f1155e3369a,Another example is if you join an art club you will have something to talk about because you both will like art.
550,3f1155e3369a,Sometimes it can be hard to open up to people and make friends but trust me doing an activity will help that tremendously.
551,3f1155e3369a,"When I first joined JV soccer I was really intimidated by all the big kids, but then I talked to them and they seemed really nice and talked to me."
552,3f1155e3369a,This goes to show that extracurricular activities can help you make friends that you would of never made if you didn't join that club.
553,ab3fe61b8eeb,Another important reason to join a club is that you could actually really enjoy it.
554,1b263824b0b2,"Even if you have no experience with an of the choices, but it sounds interesting to you then you should go for it."
555,1b263824b0b2,Trying out new things is good and you never know how good you'll be at it.
556,1b263824b0b2,If you try photography for the first time you could like it so much that you do it again next year.
557,1b263824b0b2,"Also, you could join the tennis team and realize that you're really good at it and end up becoming a famous tennis player."
558,1b263824b0b2,"However, not everyone is going to like the choices that they have."
559,1b263824b0b2,"Well, our school could have an option that students get to create a club that they would like."
560,1b263824b0b2,This solves the problem because other students could like the same thing as their peers so they would want to join that club.
561,1b263824b0b2,Someone could want to create a club for ROTC and another student may want to be in the military so they join that club.
562,1b263824b0b2,"Instead of joining a random club because you have to, try to actually find one that you enjoy."
563,1b263824b0b2,There are many choices for students because the principal want everyone to be able to do an activity that they like.
564,f151d3e0cd5b,Extracurricular activities provide lots of opportunities for students.
565,f151d3e0cd5b,You will make lots of memories and friends from joining these clubs.
566,f151d3e0cd5b,Many students have joined activities and enjoyed being involved so they kept doing that same club every year
567,8c540787b848,"However, some students may find it rude to be forced to do an activity."
568,8c540787b848,"We have homework and activities outside of school ,so why do we have to stay at school for an extra hour?"
569,8c540787b848,In order to make everyone agree with the idea of having to participate in a club we have to fix the problems.
570,a79328cd029b,"Yes, students have homework to do, so we can have each club have a specific day of the week to prevent students from staying after everyday"
571,86cc4a288245,Another issue is what if parents can't pick up their child?
572,856613ef55df,Then in that case the school will provide transportation from the school to the students bus stop
573,9ef03ff895c2,There is no reason why students shouldn't join clubs.
574,9ef03ff895c2,"Activities at your school can help you be involved, make friends, and you could enjoy the club."
575,9ef03ff895c2,This is why I agree that students should have to at least participate in one extracurricular activity.
576,f689e7feb8cb,My claim to do studying on Venus is saying no I think spending so much time and money on something that has been tempted to do multiple times and failed is wasteful.
577,025085d165df,Because we have tried on numerous accaions and have got just a few hours with a little bit of information it is not worth it.
578,025085d165df,Researchers know that they only get a super small time to only see a little bit of a huge planet.
579,5500877dbada,"Knowing that Venus is a whole planet the size of earth and only getting to see just a tiny bit of it is like starting at one side of the United States and then driving only a few hours to see how far you get, If you are trying to go all the way around the world to get back to the same spot but only have a few hours to do so, you don't cover much of anything to have any real say of how the world looks in different areas if you haven't seen it all yet."
580,b670edfc1907,In conclusion to the challenge of Venus I say it is a time waster and we will not be able to see the whole planet of Venus with only a few hours once every few decades.
581,121ac22193d7,"Do you think it would be valuble to use the Facial Action Coding System is a technolgy that read your emotions and read it off with a percentige here is an example as it says in th first pargraph she is 83 percent happy.9 percent disguested,6 percent fearfull,and 2 percent angry."

598,8a90122633f8,"Whilst it is a planet, it has numours dangers like it's chemical makeup, temperature,etc."
599,e74fcac92412,The author couldn't be any better in this story on why even with it's dangers we on earth should venture out and see what Venus is all about.
600,e74fcac92412,Giving us multiplie reasons why we need to find a way to get someone (or something) over there as soon as possible
601,15707b3bc0a3,"The first reason that was broguht upon my eyes was in paragraph eight where it states, ""~but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidation endeavors."""
602,3f85f6814324,when we are able to achieve the abilitiy to get over to our sister planet we will be able to find and conqure much more challenging issues
603,0b4e367ac559,"Another reason that the author wrote in the text was in paragraph 2 it states, ""Ofter reffered to as Earth's 'Twin,' Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."
604,754a9d45c19a,This shows me that when we are able to get over to this planet we will be able to see 'what is over on that side of the river'.Meaning that we will be able to see what the closest looking planet to earth is really about
605,eeba50cc6976,"The third and final reason the author wrote about in the passage was written in paragraph three as it stated, "" A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."
606,eeba50cc6976,Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.
607,04291ebcaea0,"This is showing me that we already know alot about the chemical makeup of this planet, but there is always something more we can figure out about this topic."
608,04291ebcaea0,Just like with anything theres always a second story or a second layer that tells us more.
609,04291ebcaea0,Here if we ever do decide to take on this task we will be able to see the entire chemical makeup of our sister planet Venus.
610,a7985f5bb26c,In conclusion the author did an amazing job by giving us (the reader) multiple reasons on why we on earth should go and venture out in our solar system and figure out what Venus is truly all about.
611,a7985f5bb26c,And maybe we'll be able to create this planet into a new habitat.
612,a7985f5bb26c,The only way we shall know is if we are able to venture out and do such.
613,a97e12032760,The new technology used to undertstand facial expressions would be a valuable thing in a classroom
614,aed9a1eef645,"This can help alot in schools,because the system will be able to understand the students emotions like confused,or bored,the system can modify and change the learning style"
615,1442704f07dc,This can increase the students studying skills and also they would learn more efficiently.
616,854a1a5b8bf2,"The text states that,a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,'Dr."
617,854a1a5b8bf2,Huang predicts.
618,854a1a5b8bf2,"""then it would be able to modify the lesson,like an effective human instructor."
619,854a1a5b8bf2,'This show that the facial recognition can help students to learn more.
620,94a448a93124,The system can help teachers alot in schools to let them know what they need to change to teach better.
621,96546e8a0ecc,In the future the facial recognizer might be able to replace teachers.
622,65fffd634488,"The idea is still to far off because the system , still doesn't understand that most human comunications are none verbal."
623,65fffd634488,The system could help solve crimes and other things it would be able to recognize if a person is lying or not by their facial expresions.
624,5809e26d9b9e,The system would be a good way to teach students at schools or at home if possible.
625,5809e26d9b9e,"Now the students will not be bored in class,neither will they be confused because the system would be able to recognize it and change it"
626,7ac9530eb601,The progam still has alot of flaws
627,0fb4feedb8e2,"but when is solved hopefully, we can have them in our classrooms in the future this could be the most valuable ""teacher"" so far it would be of a great value for schools."
628,b9e31ca13653,"In Nick D'Alto's article, "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"", the author suggests that Dr. Hung's new facial regonation would be useful for many things including using it in a class room to read stusdents' emotional expressions."
629,a99c06cc83a4,I agree with Dr. Hung that the software would be useful to help decipher mixed emoitions.
630,b4f4fdad7fdb,"In his article, he uses the Mona Lisa as an example, and I personally think that it was a good example to help show her conveyed expressions."
631,362609120277,"Dr. Hung invented the Facial Action Coding System, which helps identify the emotions displayed on the human face,and paintings such as Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa."
632,00e6abd1786e,"If this technology was used in a classroom setting, I think that it could be used to help teachers understand if some of their students are enjoying the lesson."
633,00e6abd1786e,Or it could possibly be used to tell when the students are lying to their teachers.
634,00e6abd1786e,The Facial Action Coding System shows the six basic emotion that are associated with the movements of ones facial muscles.
635,00e6abd1786e,"The basic emotions are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."
636,00e6abd1786e,This technology can also identify mixed emotions.
637,78334f89045f,Humans perfom the same amount of emotions everyday.
638,df107ad89b2e,"For example, a friend could probably tell how you feel by looking at your face."
639,df107ad89b2e,But some people might have trouble describing what each facial expression means.
640,df107ad89b2e,Dr. Hung had oserved had aritists like leonardo who had studied human anatomy that had helped them to paint human emotions.
641,df107ad89b2e,"Similarly, Professor Hungs Facial Action Coding System is able to be electorically stored with some information about human anatomty and emotions."
642,0bb207fbe3ce,"Lastly, there are fourty-four major muscles in the human face."
643,0bb207fbe3ce,For example.
644,0bb207fbe3ce,a muscle called the obricularis oculi pars palabraeus is the muscle that makes the crow's-feet shape around your eyes.
645,0bb207fbe3ce,Experts can tell a real smile from a fake smile by the way your mouth is moved.
646,0bb207fbe3ce,"Facial muscles can help produce emotions, by the movement of your muscles."
647,ec435962a7cf,"With the help of the Facial Action Coding System, I think that teachers could easily figure out the emotions that their students faces are conveying."
648,c2f1141f3b7e,"This coding system seems to be revelotionary to me because of it can decipher emotions and it could help many people such as students, teachers, and even the government."
649,30e9374f29fc,"In conclusion, I personally think that with the help of this technology teachers will be able to read into their students emotions better."
650,30e9374f29fc,"Also, teachers would be able to tell if students are lying to them."
651,30e9374f29fc,The value of this technolgy would be able to help them read the facial expressions of many people with diasbilites who have trouble conveying emotions.
652,30e9374f29fc,I beleive that is this type of technology were to be used in a classroom that it would be a great help to many teachers.
653,b890c1310b23,"When I think about schools, I think about a little community because that's basically what it is."
654,b890c1310b23,"Everyone is together for most of the day,every single day."
655,b890c1310b23,So yes I agree with everyone doing one extracurricular activity that way everyone has tried it and be part of the community.
656,1edce1cc95f7,something to take into consideration is that i dont think the kids will really go.
657,69c65c10e9b6,So there's pros and cons in this I know that but deciding if its something I truly believe in then no.
658,0b3a73793a9f,Another con about the extracurricular activity is not every parent has time to pick their kid up after school because they rather pick the kids up instead of letting their kid walk home alone.
659,8c175dd01776,Do I believe this is a good idea?
660,8c175dd01776,Yes
661,0e849a2aad1a,"but that's not the question,the question was do I agree with it?"
662,0e849a2aad1a,No I don't.
663,18200bd92f5b,"Im one of the kids that don't have time for this activity so knowing how my day goes and trying to add on it,really isnt gonna be good for me"
664,6469c7e03311,"For the kids that do have the time and effort to actually do it can do it but it shouldnt have to be pushed on somebody to do it, it just be there like an option just in case you do have extra time and are able to really do it."
665,bd12ca9f984b,"The kids should want to do these things so they can join but if its not possible then it shouldnt be pushed on them,kids should have a choice if they wanna commit do something like that."
666,3610b426dbec,"The point is most of the kids just don't commit or have time or family events, everyone is different you can't just expect every kid just to go."
667,3610b426dbec,So no I dont agree with what the princlai said at all and it should be there for kids to choose it or not for them to force it on the kids.
668,fc524f7af595,There once was three citizen friends from boston who wanted who wanted to limit car usage to 70 percent they realized it was a good idea
669,61807b429e02,it'll help people avdanced experiment in low-car suburban life but its basic precepts are being adopted around the world
670,ea70f90919bf,attempts to make suburbs more compact and more accessible to public transportation with less parking space in this new approach stores are far away to walk to on a main street rather than in small malls around some distant highway
671,4da36400d2f3,its a good idea because if they give up their cars therre will less traffic no accidents or any parking space
672,8280bd4af48e,it will be less problems with people they think if they give up there cars there will be a safer street for everyone
673,44c71e47eef7,some people didnt like idea because if they give up there cars they wont be able to get to their jobs on time and at the same some people live to far from jobs and homes that they want keep people driving their cars
674,5621a557205a,"""We have to join a club?"""
675,5621a557205a,"Generic_Name said shocked, ""Like, we have to?""."
676,5621a557205a,Generic_Name looked confused and slightly angry.
677,5621a557205a,"""Yes Generic_Name, you do have to join a club, it's a requirement for the new year."""
678,5621a557205a,said Principal Generic_Name.
679,5621a557205a,"Generic_Name looked down than looked back up at his principal, ""Great."""
680,5621a557205a,Generic_Name said sarcastically.
681,5621a557205a,Generic_Name spent that school day looking around and asking about the different clubs the school offers.
682,5621a557205a,"While Generic_Name was looking, one club caught his eye."
683,5621a557205a,The gaming club.
684,5621a557205a,"When Generic_Name was out of school he always played video games, it was his favorite pass time!"
685,5621a557205a,"Since the gaming club was the only club that sounded remotely appealing to Generic_Name, he signed up."
686,5621a557205a,"His first day in the club, he was skeptical, but he quickly realized the club was far better than he expected."
687,5621a557205a,2 weeks passed since Generic_Name joined and he already made plenty of new friends and learned about many new games that he grew to love.
688,37992f5647e5,Schools should make it a requirement for all students participate in a extracurricular activity
689,c0392ffc652d,"it helps students meet new people and make new friends,"
690,e70acbb5ce88,it can introduce students to something they've overlooked or have never heard of before
691,390f043ecb8b,it can increase social activity among students.
692,c16fba1027c3,having students join and participate in an extracurricular activity can help them meet new people and make new friends.
693,3f78eb74796e,Joining an extracurricular activity such as a club or a sports team can be very beneficial to students.
694,3f78eb74796e,Having students join clubs can help shy students talk to new people and make more friends.
695,3f78eb74796e,Even someone who is frequently talkative and already has a lot of friends can meet and talk to new people who share the same interests as them in the club.
696,3f78eb74796e,"Having friends who share your interests is something that every student wants, and joining an extracurricular activity can help students achieve that."
697,3f78eb74796e,It was only Generic_Name's first day in the club when he met two people who would later become his best friends.
698,3f78eb74796e,"""Hello,"" said a voice Generic_Name has never heard, ""My name is Generic_Name.""."
699,3f78eb74796e,"Generic_Name looked at Generic_Name and shook his hand, ""Hey Generic_Name, i'm Generic_Name."
700,3f78eb74796e,"Nice too meet you""."
701,3f78eb74796e,The person standing behind Generic_Name introduced himself next.
702,3f78eb74796e,"""Sup Generic_Name."
703,3f78eb74796e,"My name's Generic_Name, I'm Generic_Name's Friend."""
704,3f78eb74796e,he said.
705,3f78eb74796e,"""Nice too meet you as well Generic_Name."""
706,3f78eb74796e,Generic_Name replied.
707,3f78eb74796e,"Generic_Name, Generic_Name and Generic_Name quickly became good friends because of their similar interests."
708,081439ace80c,"requiring students to join an extracurricular activity can introduce students to something they've overlooked in the past, or something completely new."
709,0cbd4c5b7a4c,"Students have their interests, they either like something, or they don't."
710,0cbd4c5b7a4c,Something might not come off as interesting to them at first glance.
711,0cbd4c5b7a4c,They might only start to realize something is interesting to them when they take another look.
712,0cbd4c5b7a4c,"If schools do an event that shows off each different club, students will get that ""second glance"" that they need."
713,0cbd4c5b7a4c,"For example, my older brother wanted to join a club in high school."
714,0cbd4c5b7a4c,He looked through the website and found that nothing sounded interesting to him.
715,0cbd4c5b7a4c,"He decided to look again, this time actually reading the descriptions of each club."
716,0cbd4c5b7a4c,He eventually found the art club.
717,0cbd4c5b7a4c,"He read the description, thought it sounded interesting and signed up."
718,506f1d68d554,ubs and sports are very social activities.
719,506f1d68d554,"If they're in a club, students are basically required to socialize with others."
720,506f1d68d554,"This for the most part is a very positive benefit, allowing students to talk to others who share similar interests with them."
721,506f1d68d554,Students may even spend time outside the clubs with the people they've met.
722,506f1d68d554,"For example, my cousin Generic_Name's mom, forced Generic_Name to join a club."
723,506f1d68d554,She said Generic_Name wasn't socializing enough and spent to much time time on his computer.
724,506f1d68d554,Generic_Name asked around to find a club that was preferably easy.
725,506f1d68d554,"He eventually found the computer club which aligned with his interests, and his want to spite my aunt by ""playing on computers"" in his club."
726,506f1d68d554,Despite that my aunt got her wish and Generic_Name became more social outside of school with his new club.
727,506f1d68d554,Generic_Name had spent his entire 10th grade year in the gaming club.
728,506f1d68d554,Now that summer was approaching for the first time in his life he felt sad about leaving during the summer.
729,506f1d68d554,Generic_Name never thought by joining a club his perception about school would change this drastically.
730,506f1d68d554,"The next day Generic_Name and his club talked about meeting up over the summer, everyone was ecstatic about the idea."
731,506f1d68d554,"Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and Generic_Name all have met up before outside of the club before, but the entire club has never got together like this."
732,506f1d68d554,School ended just as fast as it started and the day quickly approached when the club would get back together again.
733,25e66e444fd3,"schools should make it so all students have to participate in an extracurricular activity such as a club or a sport because it helps students make new friends and build relationships, it can introduce students to something they've overlooked in the past, and it can increase social activity among students."
734,06d48a75b4e7,"According to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" there is a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) that enables computers to identify human emotions."
735,06d48a75b4e7,This technology is relatively brand new.
736,06d48a75b4e7,It creates a 3-D computer model of all fourty-four major muscles in the face that move like human muscles as well.
737,06d48a75b4e7,"Then, psychologists have classified six basic emotions that are associated with different movements in the facial mucles."
738,06d48a75b4e7,This new technology could result in many benefits in our community as well as all around the world
739,4c2ee7d56e14,The use of the Facial Action Coding System to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable
740,e32e969cc4cd,it would allow teachers to know when students become confused
741,0b50478a23f6,are being dishonest
742,1dc51077c58a,or are depressed and possibly having problems at home.
743,c7f8ef78a014,"In the classroom, it is common for students to tend to get confused while being taught a lesson."
744,c7f8ef78a014,It is also common for students to get bored and become uninterested in the lesson at hand.
745,c7f8ef78a014,"With the Facial Action Coding System, teachers can make sure that their students are acquiring the best education possible and absorbing all of the material."
746,14ecb8656a88,Teachers can adapt their teaching style according to how students respond to the lesson being taught.
747,14ecb8656a88,"This way, both the students and teachers can be on the same page, making education easier for students and teachers."
748,14ecb8656a88,"The article states,""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts."
749,14ecb8656a88,"'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,'"" (D'Alto)."
750,14ecb8656a88,"In this quote, Dr. Huang is telling the reader how this new technology could possibly develop into something much bigger where it can modify the lesson for students who become bored or confused, making it an easier and better experience for the student."
751,785412ef219c,School behavior is a big part of a students education.
752,785412ef219c,If a student is constantly acting out and misbehaving it could affect his or her education pretty badly.
753,785412ef219c,"Although, that is why Facial Action Coding Systems could also be very useful in a classroom environment."
754,d8b8c79aa4a0,"The technology could be able to detect if a student is being dishonest, which could prove very handy when dealing with situations with delinquents and trouble-makers."
755,ad0978b95e70,"In the excerpt, the author writes, ""To an expert, faces don't lie; these muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a ""smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful,"" (D'Alto)."
756,ad0978b95e70,"In this quote, the author tells the reader about some facial muscle clues that allow experts to tell if a famous figure is being dishonest."
757,ad0978b95e70,These are some of the same facial clues the FACS looks for.
758,0fecf4ba1b67,"Finally, The FACS could help find if students are depressed or having problems at home."
759,02f438f0f765,"The machine can detect six different emotions, including sadness."
760,02f438f0f765,This could prove useful when dealing with distressed students.
761,02f438f0f765,"""Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" (D'Alto)."
762,02f438f0f765,This quotes tells the reader about the emotions the machine can read.
763,650c08a58c4c,"Just before the bell rings to dismiss students for year, teachers are struggling to keep the attention of students when explaining their summer assignments for the break."
764,650c08a58c4c,"The students know that the summer assignments are important, but their attention is on the bell that declares summer vacation."
765,650c08a58c4c,Summer assignments are designed to ensure that students continue their intellectual journey over breaks.
766,650c08a58c4c,"Both teacher-designed projects and student-designed projects accomplish this goal, however, one of the biggest challenges is deciding whether teacher-designed projects or student-designed project would do a better job at accomplishing this goal"
767,9f078f11ffa4,The best way to ensure that students continue learning over break is to assign teacher-designed projects.
768,65ca1a573d76," Summer projects should be teacher-designed because teachers have a better understanding of the material,"
769,1ce0fdfad21e,the project will be less stressful for students
770,64d1e153fde7,teacher-designed projects will prevent misjudgment of students by teachers.
771,24f03257e7db,Teachers should design summer projects because they have a better understanding of the material they are trying to teach.
772,e3c24f15136a,They also tend to have a clear understanding of what they expect from students for the projects they assign.
773,e3c24f15136a,"By assigning teacher-designed summer projects, the teacher can guide the students to learn what the teachers want them to discover."
774,e3c24f15136a,They also provide a more specific rubric so the students know exactly what is expected of them.
775,e3c24f15136a,"For example, AP Biology has a lot of material that needs to be covered in just one year."
776,e3c24f15136a,"To solve this issue, they assign a teacher-designed summer assignment that consists of an introduction to each unit learned throughout the year."
777,e3c24f15136a,"This way, students are prepared when going in depth with all of the concepts in class because they already have a grasp of the topic learned during break."
778,e3c24f15136a,"By assigning teacher designed projects, teachers can guide the students to ensure that what they are learning and exploring can help them perform better in class."
779,90c383808181,"Another reason teachers should design the summer project, is that the project will be less stressful to students overall."
780,246544c60f06,"Although teachers are expected to be unbiased, they will always have personal beliefs that may clash with a student's beliefs."
781,246544c60f06,"During student-designed projects over the summer, students do not know the personal beliefs and preferences of their teacher because many students have not spent much time with their future teacher."
782,246544c60f06,Student-designed projects are often stressful in this situation because students do not always know the teacher's expectations.
783,246544c60f06,Students do not want to receive a lower grade on their project because of the biases of the teacher.
784,246544c60f06,Students also feel anxious because they never know if their project is unique enough to get a good grade and if the teacher will find it as interesting as the student.
785,246544c60f06,"For example, many science classes require students to conduct experiments in a field they find interesting."
786,246544c60f06,"Not only is this assignment very vague, but it is also unfair."
787,246544c60f06,There are many different ways a student could take this project and some projects require more time and effort than others.
788,246544c60f06,"For example, testing to see the effects of personal care products that get into waterways on marine life requires a lot more time, effort, and materials compared to testing which brand of paint needs the least amount to coats to adequately cover the walls."
789,246544c60f06,"Both of the projects meet the criteria, but one project may be considered better than the other by a teacher."
790,246544c60f06,This gives many students anxiety because they never know if their project is good enough.
791,246544c60f06,Student-designed projects are too stressful and often end up diminishing the quality of the student's summer break by giving them anxiety.
792,7e2bdeb97c63,Some teachers may argue that student-designed summer projects are an outlet for students to show their creativity.
793,7e2bdeb97c63,They believe that students can showcase their intellectual level by completing student-designed projects and the teachers can get a better understanding of their students' beliefs and preferences through student-designed projects
794,caba48ef6688,"However, student-designed projects are not always the best reflection of the students and their work ethic."
795,78587f04e153,Many students go on vacation during the summer for extended periods of time and may not always be able to do what they actually wanted to do.
796,78587f04e153,Many students visit family in places that do not have the internet or adequate resources to complete the project that they wanted to complete.
797,78587f04e153,"For example, if a student wanted to test the effects of personal care products that get into waterways on marine life, it would be impossible for them to do so if their relatives lived in an underdeveloped and remote village in India because they would not have access to the materials they need."
798,08355c914e5f,"However, with teacher-designed projects, students can work with their future teacher to plan ahead to complete the assignment or complete a different assignment entirely depending on their situation."
799,08355c914e5f,Students would not be forced to settle for something that is not a true reflection of their work ethic because of their circumstances.
800,4160ddc6c16e,Teacher-designed projects are the best way for schools to ensure that students continue learning material for classes during break without causing anxiety in students or misjudgment of students by teachers.
801,4160ddc6c16e,Summer projects are meant to help students but student-designed projects can sometimes harm students instead.
802,4160ddc6c16e,Every student should be allowed to spend their summer without stressing about how they will be perceived by their fellow classmates and teachers the next year.
803,4160ddc6c16e,Summer projects should encourage students to continue to learning while also spending quality time with their family and friends during their break.
804,6af5e509bac8,"Growing up in a constantly changing environment, students have had to learn to adapt to the world around them."
805,6af5e509bac8,"In school, students are taught to be open and ready to learn, while still facing the ups and downs in the journey of childhood to adulthood."
806,6af5e509bac8,Students make close bonds with their friends and even a few choice teachers.
807,6af5e509bac8,Students choose to whom they share their emotions with and at what time they wish to do so
808,c6551a98569e,"Emplimenting a computer system in schools that is capable of reading a students emotions is inappropriate, lazy, and dangerous."
809,639ee76a0b2a,This technology is incredible.
810,639ee76a0b2a,It's capable of easily figuring out what someone feels right when they're feeling it.
811,639ee76a0b2a,Empathy is an intimate ability one experiences with another.
812,639ee76a0b2a,"Most people have the ability to sense others emotions, ""For instance, you can probably telll how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."""
813,639ee76a0b2a,There is a prominent understanding in the natural world regarding emotions
814,c78c479fb102,Sometimes not every one wants to be figured out and displayed to their peers.
815,879bf316f666,"In school, students are faced with one major task: to learn."
816,879bf316f666,Teachers are faced with the task of teaching.
817,879bf316f666,A teacher's job is to engage students and the students job is to stay engaged with the teacher.
818,39d32ef68ce1,"Emplementing facial reading teachnology is innappropriate and dangerous to the privacy of students, and it threatens the basic principles school systems were founded upon."
819,2664e005195e,"Furthermore, this technology could be used in the wrong situations."
820,2664e005195e,"The article stated that a smart school computer could tell when students are getting bored or confused and change the lesson, ""' A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts."
821,2664e005195e,"Then is could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.'"""
822,2664e005195e,This example puts teachers in an awkward position.
823,2664e005195e,"Letting a smart, facial reading technology teach students would mean the teachers aren't teaching"
824,566b15f4a243,"Giving power to technology is complacent, instead of working with people to improve learning habits or teaching methods, adults would be taking the easy way out."
825,26a803f09b99,Some might argue that these computers might be a useful tool for counselors in schools
826,4327343f6057,"This is a valid argument, but this also compromises the position of school counselors."
827,a3b232606843,Their job is to connect and work with students.
828,a3b232606843,"When introducing a computer system, students may realize they are just another task to be completed in the work place."
829,a3b232606843,"Every year, students are analyzed to see where they place on the national benchmark for their education, they take standardized tests to see how much they know, they do hearing tests and eye tests, but a computer has yet to analyze them to see how happy they might be."
830,a3b232606843,"If computers are introduced to read emotions, students may feel like they are just a number or rank of emotions."
831,a3b232606843,"If students go to their counselors, they want to be talked to and connected with."
832,a3b232606843,Bringing in a computer can divide the connection from child to adult.
833,a3b232606843,The child may feel alienated and refuse to converse with the adult.
834,a3b232606843,"This computer may seem like a helpful tool, but it destroys the importance of human connection."
835,d9894f1d324b,"The age of computers is inescapable, but it doesn't have to be."
836,d9894f1d324b,"Instead of computer analyzed emotional connection, people should put their phones down and ask each other how they are."
837,d9894f1d324b,"Not every person wants their emotions analyzed, especially in schools."
838,d9894f1d324b,Students bonds with teachers are simply student to teacher; a child must trust an adult before they talk about their feelings.
839,d9894f1d324b,"Computer facial technology might be helpful, but not in schools."
840,d9894f1d324b,This technology falls flat in the category of connection.
841,d9894f1d324b,"Don't take the easy way out, instead of analyzing emotions with a computer, ask someone how they are."
842,d9894f1d324b,"If a student looks upset, sit down and talk with them."

844,8cd0045c76c1,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggest that studing venus is worth while even though their are extreme dangers while doing it."
845,9949042e82e8,"The author supports this idea in the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" by the similarites to earth making the dangers worth while"
846,63dd59c75d2e,"the testing on diffrent pieces of equitmeant to withstand the extreme climate of venus,"
847,034f064f31b0,the life they believe was once their making it a plave they want to explore.
848,8592b977ce3a,The author in the article explains many resons in which he or she thinks the dangers of venus are worth it for science
849,53e943046fba,one of them being the similarities which they can see from far distance the planet has to earth.
850,53e943046fba,"the author says Venus is often referred to as the earths twin due to the size, mountain like, and believed to have many oceans and waterways making venus very simlar to the earth."
851,53e943046fba,with venus being the closest planet as well to the earth having a closer distance to venus from earth.
852,9b5570fda4d5,Though Venus is concidered the twin to earth it has many diffrent features making it dangerous for scientist to explore the planet.
853,9b5570fda4d5,One of these extreme dangers is the diffrence in climate as said in the article Venus reaches upwards of 800 degrees Fahrenheit easily melting most metals making it hard to recieve samples from the planet.
854,77051e84a016,Though they have tested many new products in chambler ith simlar climate to venus finding new ways to hopefully find more out about Venus.
855,23d7f5047608,lastly the author also talks about how Venus most likely had life on the planet similar to that of earths
856,d9f1d084a2a4,scientist are interested in finding out more about this even though many dangers are included in this task.
857,d9f1d084a2a4,Finding new ways to make sysems in which can be sent to Venus is difficult but found early computers with physical componets might be the key to their succsess in finding out avout Venus past.
858,83c2f9800394,"In conclution Venus has many similarities to earth, but due to the extreme conditions of Venus it makes it hard for scientist to explore and find out more about the planet, even though it is the closest to the planet earth."
859,83c2f9800394,"These dagers and risk are worthwhile due to the simlarities the earth shares with venus, the new test of equtmeant in which can withstand these climates, and the life in which they believe use to be on Venus all make exporing Venus, even with dangers worth the time."
860,cc2efa0fe5a8,Students often moan and groan about summer projects that their teachers assign them to do over summer break to assure they continue learning over the period they are not in school.
861,cc2efa0fe5a8,"The projects most of the time, have a set rule book to follow that was issued by the teacher and it makes the project boring and not enjoyable for the students to do, basically being a burden the students have to over come during their relaxing summer break."
862,40ea6ed111a6,These projects that get assign should be more student-designed
863,54a14c3b2912,students can be more freely creative with their own ideas
864,0ed365b17352,"it will be more enjoyable to do for them,"
865,207081c30a25,they can continue learning in a more ideal way.
866,1c8e67ec973b,"Having the project be more student-designed, students would not have to struggle with limitations and can be more creative and use their own ideas for a better outcome of the project."
867,4994c2009caf,"Teachers often put a strict instructional guide or manual on what to do and what not to do, during the assignment and limits what students can do and blocks any originality."
868,4994c2009caf,"However, having a student-designed project will unleash a wave of ideas and flow of creativity between each student that would not normally be received from a common project."
869,4994c2009caf,"The whole outcome of the entire project will be changed drastically because of the freedom students will have on their own projects and in which, in the end, will satisfy them."
870,4994c2009caf,"During research projects, teachers also frequently limit the student on what they can look up and use."
871,4994c2009caf,"If the project was student-designed, students can freely look up and use what interest them and learn about something that will make them more engaged into the project."
872,4994c2009caf,"They can not be held by idea blocking rules that will make the project disengaging, they can have creativity run free throughout the entire assignment and it will show."
873,4994c2009caf,"Overall, a student-designed project will make a more standout project due to the original ideas students will leave throughout the project."
874,7d2a16a2146a,The sound of a project over the summer break already sounds boring and a headache of a time for any person in school to do but students will always be more engaged in a project that will allow their own unique spin on it and uses a piece of mind from them.
875,d7ecd3d9dff6,"The thought of a project is always a dreadful one that all, will have a hard time to get them self to do it but a student-designed project will make it at least, a more enjoyable experience."
876,d7ecd3d9dff6,Students can utilize their brain and knowledge to make it a project to remember and have fun while thinking of an idea to blow teachers and fellow classmates away once they return from break.
877,d7ecd3d9dff6,"For example, a science fair allows students to show a unique idea with experiments, this causes fun competition and a enjoyable process on how the project is going to ""wow' the judges."
878,d7ecd3d9dff6,"Speaking of competition, if the project would also have an incentive to try to achieve the best project, students would even be more thrilled."
879,d7ecd3d9dff6,The student-designed project will show a big amount of their own ability to the assignment and make them strive for the number one spot.
880,d7ecd3d9dff6,This would heighten the accomplishment of the project and give them a sense of excitement for their own unique project to compete with classmates.
881,d7ecd3d9dff6,"In the end, rather than having a normal boring project, students who have a chance to design their own project, will have a lot more fun and excitement in the process of doing the project, in which, will still allow them to learn and not interrupt with their fun and relaxing summer break."
882,bc3bed9f6995,"Projects also have a based way of learning, a way teachers think it's best for our generation to learn, but they are not our generation, they do not know what is best for us, they just think it; by allowing students to freely design their project, they can learn in their own ideal way."
883,e3cceed8d845,"When teachers assign projects that are related to the class, it is reasonable because it help us understand the subject more, but when they assign a regular project, especially one over summer break, it is often a misguided project on what they think students want to learn but does not really aid them."
884,e3cceed8d845,"Giving the chance for a student to do something they want to learn about, will get them more engaged and give them their ideal way of learning."
885,e3cceed8d845,They would not have to worry about what teachers think they should learn but rather what they want to learn and will aid them in the future.
886,e3cceed8d845,Students who do a project about what they want to learn will make doing a project like that more enjoyable over a summer break rather than a set learning experience.
887,e3cceed8d845,"They will gather more information to aid them in what they want to do, instead of being given something they think they should do, this will make the learning experience way beneficial for them and not waste their time in the long run."
888,e3cceed8d845,They can continue to learn educational information for them and gain more knowledge that matches their learning style and will satisfy what they have learned.
889,e3cceed8d845,"Therefore, students would have a better learning experience if they could do projects their own way and had design freedom and not be held down by a set learning path."
890,4e7e0fcc22ec,Projects being put out during summer break will always be a boring and overbearing thing to complete and in some cases even ruin summer break for them overall just to learn information that teachers assign.
891,4e7e0fcc22ec,"Having the project be student-designed, however, will change the entire assignment in all, giving more creativity, better pacing, more enjoyment, and a better learning experience for students all around, it will benefit them rather than a teacher-designed project."
892,4e7e0fcc22ec,"All projects, even ones put out over summer break, should be student-designed because the outcome will have more uniqueness with student's ideas, the project overall will be more fun, and students will learn in their own learning way."
893,a0753f4378d0,Would you enjoy your summer if you were required to do some project that didn't intrest you?
894,a0753f4378d0,A project based off of something not to your liking or one that is so boring it would put you to sleep?
895,cae823862850,Here's why students should be allowed to come up with their own school project to make sure they continue learning over summer.
896,07233d4fa0f7,Students would be more likely to want to continue learning by doing their own designed project because they will do it on a subject they want to know more about and intrested in
897,b26e804e17d7,the project would be more likely done if choosen by them
898,c157a8b523dd,it wont feel as required if its student choosen.
899,57c8bbf272c4,Some people might think it should be teacher based
900,3653fc065a39,some students wouldnt like the topic or the teacher would want them to include certain things students might not know how to do or would like to include in their project.
901,3653fc065a39,This will also give them less freedom of choosing there style of project.
902,3653fc065a39,Teacher based projects would also be more educational based off of things they teach and wouldnt intrest students and it would be msot likely not turned in by the end of summer.
903,f270a4fe032a,Students would do a project on a topic they want to know more about and intrested in.
904,2c50589a38ee,"If the project were to be teacher based, most students wouldn't be intrested in it, therefore, some students wouldn't want to do the project and will have the lack of wanting to learn about something that doesn't intrest them and make it a chore."
905,2c50589a38ee,"Making a student choose a topic for their project would, make them choose something they're intrested in and they will most likely have a project ready to turn in at the end of summer."
906,2c50589a38ee,Student would also complete the project with more detail instead of not having any at all.
907,2c50589a38ee,All the projects would be different subject and more unique letting students choose so teachers can make sure students learned.
908,ff3b9f780242,Some students have summer jobs or go travel to different location's
909,abfe38e49746,When student's are given the choice of choosing their own school project they will have less of a chance of forgetting that they have to do one or forgetting what they have learned about
910,69fee98034da,This will also give them a chance on choosing what style of what of project they want.
911,69fee98034da,They could do it on paper or poster or power point and many more.
912,69fee98034da,Students coud also base it off of the schedule they have or the days that are free.
913,44773b4967d6,Student based projects would be more likely done then teacher based projects.
914,44773b4967d6,Students would do them off of things they are interested in and subjects that catch their attention.
915,44773b4967d6,They will do it around there time frame and in any style they want.
916,44773b4967d6,doing it student based will have students educate them selves about things they enjoy and love to do on daily bases and teachers will have something turned in to them by the end of summer.
917,f25b7d1bb6fa,Summer projects are given to students so they can continue to learn and not fall behind in the coming school year.
918,f25b7d1bb6fa,But would it help if the summer projects are created by teachers?
919,f25b7d1bb6fa,"Well yes, teachers have been teaching and making projects for a long time and they would know what they are doing."
920,f25b7d1bb6fa,As a high school student I could prefer that my teacher makes the projects verse some student who not much of an expert on the topic.
921,f8191ae1bf28,Summer projects should be teacher-designed
922,63e2d5ada58a,"they have more experience,"
923,066648f22959,"the project can be less confusing,"
924,c2aba85d68f0,the project can give the student an insight of what the class will be like.
925,8351a520df8d,With so much experience and training they would know how to design a project that will allow the students to continue to learn through out the summer.
926,8351a520df8d,"For example, I am taking AP chemistry and there was a summer assignment."
927,8351a520df8d,This assignment was created by the teacher and it was easy to comprehend and do.
928,8351a520df8d,This made my experience with working on the project much more productive and less time consuming.
929,06aa554e38d0,Many of the projects that I have done were mostly teacher-designed and they were easy to understand and finish without too many hurdles.
930,06aa554e38d0,If there were to be any confusion it would be much easier to contact the teacher about a question than a student.
931,06aa554e38d0,When there are less mistakes in the project it would be more time effective and one would be able to finish the project faster.
932,97c49450a8fc,This would help students to be prepared for the coming year and they would also know what to expect.
933,97c49450a8fc,"For instance, when I had received a summer project for AP statistics as I was doing the project I was able to understand more about what statistic is and how the class work would be like."
934,97c49450a8fc,"However, if a student were to create the project it might not have given a picture of how the class would be like through out the year."
935,880ad5576106,schools should have summer projects that are designed by teachers.
936,880ad5576106,This way students would be more benefited due to the teachers knowledge on the topic.
937,880ad5576106,When the teachers do create the project there will be more clarity on what the student should do.
938,880ad5576106,The students will also be able to get a feel of the class in the coming year.

972,888c559a6895,"However, the extra curricular you have to participate in, took too much time."
973,888c559a6895,"That's the view of a student, if they would have to participate in a extracurricular activity."

993,664d1021b10c,"and it wouldn't be facing towards the sky, it would be like a statue, plus it would have been a really fantastic descovery and we would try to make contact with the martians and see how they live and survive on the planet so we could possibly live there one day."
994,664d1021b10c,NASA would send space crafts and rovers to Mars so we could study the creatures.
995,664d1021b10c,Finding out how to survive on mars and the other planets is important and is something humans should learn how to do just in case if something happens to earth and we aren't able to go back to it.
996,e3eeee873427,"But as you can see in the pictures it's just a messa, a natural cause in nature, something that happens on earth, but it just so happened to look so much like a face from the possible clouds and blurry picture from the first"
997,def61ded611e,"Many people at NASA want wanted that to be a statue or something that a living creaturs has made, but as you see in the pictures it starts to look more like a natural cause of natural cause."
998,df308b06ff2e,"Phones and Driving, should it be a thing?"
999,df308b06ff2e,"Today over 5 billion people own a mobile device, and a little over 1 billion own some sort of vehicle."
1000,df308b06ff2e,These are two of the things people feel they need in life.
1001,df308b06ff2e,But maybe the use of both at once is a bit too overwhelming.
1002,df308b06ff2e,"Driving while texting, or even making a phone call is excessive."
1003,df308b06ff2e,It can be dangerous and hurt people in multiple ways
1004,4681d2550939,"Phone usage while driving should be prohibited in every state, country and continent!"
1005,a883a60c1dad,Using a phone while driving a vehicle should not be allowed anywhere!
1006,a883a60c1dad,It can cause many accidents.
1007,a883a60c1dad,It can also bring troubles and pain to ones family.
1008,0b9386f6005c,"For example, in February 2018, a 17 year old in Alabaster, Alabama killed a ten year old and her father in an accident because the teen was texting while driving."
1009,0b9386f6005c,If the teen would have been paying attention to the road and not their phone the accident maybe could have been prevented.
1010,0b9386f6005c,"Not saying all accidents are caused by phone use, but a majority of them are."
1011,36a13d1683e8,Generally there are 1.6 million crashes involving texting and driving
1012,a1e5e776d75f,"Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents involving texting and driving."
1013,a1e5e776d75f,"4,637 people died in the year 2018 because of the accidents."
1014,a1e5e776d75f,"If that does not scare one into not using their phone while driving, then I don't know what will."
1015,a1e5e776d75f,This is one of the many reasons why I believe driving and the use of a phone should be banned!
1016,4dfbaf6f02de,Another reason cell phone use while driving should be banned; if adults use their phone while operating a vehicle their children will possibly be strongly influenced by it.
1017,0b3bb064b7a4,The children will start to think it is okay to do so.
1018,0b3bb064b7a4,"It is the year 2019 and all that this generation raves about is having a car and the newest IPhone if we are taught that it is okay to text and drive, someone can earnestly get hurt by these actions."
1019,0b3bb064b7a4,"Most accidents involve teen driving, we don't want to give them another reason to be absentminded while driving."
1020,53297b1e0c8a,The use of a mobile device while operating a vehicle should be prohibited.
1021,53297b1e0c8a,Now is the time to admit that driving while using a phone or any mobile devices is dangerous!
1022,53297b1e0c8a,"You wouldn't want you or a loved one to end up critically injured, dead or disabled."
1023,53297b1e0c8a,Phone usage while driving is one of the many reasons accidents happen everyday.
1024,53297b1e0c8a,You can always wait until you are out of the car to make that call or answer that text !
1025,b50a54358314,I'm Luke Bomberger I am part of the Seagoing Cowboys program.
1026,5c69d2936a37,I think you should join too
1027,dfbcba259ead,It's fun
1028,3c88e5541bda,"you do a lot of activities such as baseball, vollyball, table-tennis, fencing, boxing, reading and, whittling on the way back."
1029,3c88e5541bda,You play the games where the animals used to be.
1030,2c1cf8d1dc21,You also get to see a lot of wonderful places.
1031,ae79eb10c685,I've traveled to China and Europe.
1032,ae79eb10c685,"I saw the Acropolis in Greece, I took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy where the streets were water, I've toured an excavated castle in Crete, and saw the Panama Canal on my way to China."
1033,ae79eb10c685,We actually do have time to see places on our way to places.
1034,64db004ed267,It opens the world up to you.
1035,fd6d70ab3a5b,It's a life changing opportunity.
1036,fd6d70ab3a5b,I'm very gratefull I have that opportunity.
1037,fd6d70ab3a5b,It made me more aware of the countries in need and that awareness has always sayed with me.
1038,5d2e2aeeb928,That is why I think you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.
1039,c3707b440343,I would agree to computers that can identify humans emotions would be pretty cool for our inverment.
1040,4966d2d7da1d,it would change our inverment becaus ealot of people can just go to a computer and if the happy or sad it would say
1041,68d9b7a7c663,"I think that it would be good, because the people that hate computer would probably end up liking it."
1042,68d9b7a7c663,It would give them something new to learn on
1043,dc36f1b2f171,It can also recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel
1044,7fc0218b2a88,"Mr. Eckman has classified six basic emotions, and they are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."
1045,7fc0218b2a88,Your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) will tighten your lips to show anger.
1046,7fc0218b2a88,The same technology can make computer- animathed faces more expressive.
1047,fefdea8f580a,"Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emothins, but it also may help produce them"
1048,abf9ce144f43,You can feel other peoples emotional.
1049,abf9ce144f43,it may happen becasue they unconsciously imitate another person's facial expression
1050,dcef369fd34c,this is why i think it would be a good idea to make computers that can see how someone is feeling.
1051,dcef369fd34c,"If there sad,or mad."
1052,c34ab25756f1,I think that students should do at least one extracurricular activity.
1053,54e17fdd940a,A extracurricular activity is a great way to kill time.
1054,3f3b345d6956,First I will talk about advantages to the students.
1055,33c4f98da785,First advantage is that the kids can get more exercise and not be just lazy all the time.
1056,33c4f98da785,Another advantage is the kids can meet new people and make new friends.
1057,33c4f98da785,If its something that they like to do it can boost their mood.
1058,33c4f98da785,They might also become better problem solvers.
1059,33c4f98da785,Those are advantages to the students.
1060,404503fb5714,Second I will talk about the advantages to the teachers.
1061,775cd772a982,First advantage to teachers is they get to teach about something that they love.
1062,775cd772a982,They get to know more about the kids and what they like.
1063,775cd772a982,They could also learn something new themselves if the kids know something that the teachers don't.
1064,775cd772a982,those are advantages to the teachers that teach extracurricular activities.
1065,6f2f9f03d240,Last I will talk about advantages to the parents.
1066,0868af748809,The parents get to do more things by themselves like running errands and just spend time alone.
1067,0868af748809,It is also less time for their kid to annoy them.
1068,0868af748809,It could also make them feel good that there kid is doing something other than being lazy.
1069,0868af748809,Last it could also teach the parents something new about the extra curricular activity.
1070,0868af748809,Those are the advantages for the parents of kids doing the activity.
1071,2639324f7ebc,Those are all my reasons why I think kids should do at least one extracurricular activity.
1072,2639324f7ebc,My essay also shows that not just the kids have the advantages but the teachers and parents to do.
1073,6d2284059d0a,the author article about studying venus is good.
1074,6d2284059d0a,My opnion is that we should study Venus because that can be a good thing for us
1075,f4a4fd5060a7,because if something goies wrong here maybe we can use Venus so we can go live over there.
1076,f4a4fd5060a7,Its good that we should study it so they can see that needs to be done and we need to survive if we ever have to leave earth
1077,1cd76997a994,I read in the article that is dangerous because they are lava and earthquakes and venus has the hottest surface temperature in any planet .
1078,1cd76997a994,"i rad it on paragraph 3 line 10 "" venus has the hottest surface termaperatures of any planet in out solar system""."
1079,1cd76997a994,"i read about the volcanos and eraquakes on paragraph 3 line 13 "" erupting volcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes""."
1080,c7a4eae7a573,"they refer venus like "" the earths twin"" if they call me like that is for a reason maybe it can really be like the earth a place where humans can live there without a problem."
1081,fbc02450ab33,"Venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus> Its on paragraph 3 line 1 "" A thick atmosphere of amost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus""."
1082,fbc02450ab33,the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus atmosphere.
1083,fbc02450ab33,Its on paragraph 3 line 3.
1084,fbc02450ab33,"So its really dangerous but if they want to study it its for a reason maybe there is things they are can do to fix it so it can be a good place where humans can live,"
1085,7769a1ae7f74,We should study Venus is a perfect oppurtunity for us to study new planets and see what we can do to have another safe planet.
1086,7769a1ae7f74,Its gonna be dangerous but i believe that we have the right tools and the right equiment to go over there and we have really good machines so they can work in there .
1087,685fc575f97b,In society techolgy is almost every thing to people.
1088,685fc575f97b,"People around the world hundred, thousands worth of technology, lots of people spend more money on technology than they clothes."
1089,685fc575f97b,So to me I think having technology makes people happy.
1090,685fc575f97b,Having technology to see if it makes them happy is kinda of point less to me
1091,723d85e86c96,There is nothing the Facial Action Coding could do for people in the world if you ask me.
1092,b1417052a212,Putting up Ads that is based off your emotion is not a smart idea to me
1093,2d0b1a812373,So if im angry im most likely will have a negative vibe and if you put something up that is close to be negative its not going to make me happy.
1094,2d0b1a812373,If I am in a good mood more than likely I would not want to see no Ad.
1095,2d0b1a812373,"Then there expression is compared against a neutral face, some people just look naturally mad."
1096,2d0b1a812373,"If some one regular face looks mad then how would it read ther face then, that person could be happy."
1097,2a8e47324857,I think the Facial Action Coding System is a waste of time.
1098,559eeee0cfa4,Every teacher should use this in their class room because the teacher could see what each student is feeling inside
1099,4557fecb9208,"Also the teacher could see if the student is learning,listening, or even liking what the subject is"
1100,cf8a0d62c51d,"It says ""moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them''."
1101,cf8a0d62c51d,I think that is very true and hopefully it would make people more happy and not feel like they are nothing.
1102,42ac4ed5d1aa,If people could make enough of the Facial Action Coding System for the schools all around the world.
1103,42ac4ed5d1aa,I think that would make a big difference on people not lieing about how the feel.
1104,895a0d73f12a,It would help people be better with computers if the computers understand howthe person if feeling.
1105,11fbc2a61026,It would me a great game too.
1106,d8de94b76489,You try to make the other person try to guess your emotion and the computer would tell you if they got it right or not
1107,df8949b06ec5,"I think this would be really good to get out to schools to show them how to see different emotions about people and like i said before, it would make a great game."
1108,1ab1030c639a,Disagree
1109,c31923fc7fac,I think that if a students have to let them do it not because them say u got to
1110,55372759ebbd,some people can not do some thing like some people can not do sports like working want people some work just there self some teacher don't do activity the principal don't why should the student do some just not that good what.
1111,dd417b39b1d4,Activity thing some just not for everyone cut out for the workout to play sports.
1112,f4dbba7c9463,It good to play do activiy but it a lot thing to do outside have fun or some we young sports is fun to but no one want to be and a hot gym half of the day out of energy when you get home you get home you going want to go to bed going to want to eat and sleep that it now activty a lot eat and sleep that it now activty a lot of work some don't like now who want sit after scool to do some work
1113,2929f3867c66,I would join this program because I can help people in needs and I could travel and see things that I wanted to see a long time ago I could travel all around the world all day every day of the week.
1114,c7c741ef126f,I like to support Luke for being brave to go out in the bigh world
1115,a2112db79e7b,he just got out of high school and he only lives in a small town were very few pepole live.
1116,a2112db79e7b,That is the reason i would like to do that program see u next
1117,22ed56154254,I support Lukes claims because they are very useful for the activty that he is duing
1118,2aa5f3fed268,i personnaly support Luke for caring because he didn't have to help people survive.
1119,59474ed29a4d,Luke is a very brave person and i support him for that
1120,327e1d23624f,i like Luke if he was ral or if he is i would like to meet him in person to say how much he helped those people he is a very good person to others.
1121,da366deadae7,I would join this program to help Luke and save lifes
1122,16a565a61644,I really like Luke he seems like a very helpful person and very succesful in life he didn't give up on school or those animals or the people who needed him to help and they probaly thank him for what he has done.
1123,570ad5743cf4,I like the fact that the program teachs you resopnsabilty in life
1124,3eea124f22ff,how you can't just think about your self and think about others to and be helpful to others and that is just what Luke did he cared for the other people and not just himself and he cared for animals cause if Luke and Don wouldn't have saved them animals they would be dead or extinct.
1125,fd26616a742a,"Mona Lisa Smile she is 83 percent happy,9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful, and 2 percent anger."
1126,fd26616a742a,Mona Lisan Smile her emotional is less because here happy is hight and not low.
1127,fd26616a742a,She have being sad but she have being mad.
1128,fd26616a742a,Her anger was 2 percent that is less.
1129,fd26616a742a,She have more emotional smiling.
1130,fd26616a742a,But she have a little fearful.
1131,fd26616a742a,Mona Lisa Smile at last according to the some new computer software that can recognize her emotions.
1132,fd26616a742a,"Thomas Huang, ge tge beckmqn institute for Advanced Science at the University of lllinois, working in collaboration with the Prof. Nicu sebe he are the Universitycof tge Amsterdam."
1133,fd26616a742a,Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at the developing vetter ways for the human and computers to communicate.
1134,fd26616a742a,And they was talking about the calulate emotions like a math homework?
1135,fd26616a742a,and how can they computers the recongnize of the subtle facial movements.
1136,fd26616a742a,And they have the humans use to express how we feel.
1137,fd26616a742a,And they was staring making comuter constructs a 3-D computer nodel of the face; all the 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscles.
1138,fd26616a742a,"And movement of the one more muscles is called an""action unit."""
1139,fd26616a742a,"Than Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists, as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of tge FACS ( Facial Action Coding System)."
1140,fd26616a742a,"And theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only Expresses emotions, but also the may even help produce them."
1141,fd26616a742a,May happen because they unconsciously imitata another person of the facial expressions.
1142,fd26616a742a,And whoever thought of that making faces could reveal so much abouf the scepience of the emotions.
1143,65a8f1bc4c01,"There is a saying that goes as this; ""You can't make everyone happy."""
1144,65a8f1bc4c01,"One would typically use this saying if an action they make improves the situation for one person, but creates a worse situation for another."
1145,65a8f1bc4c01,"However, if Professor Thomas Huang's new 'Facial Action Coding System' proves to be what he says it can be, then Huang believes that there actually is a way to make everyone happy, even in the school setting."
1146,da693397195e,The implementation of technology able to read the emotional expressions of children in the classroom is valuable for both the teachers and the students.
1147,a68b220b794b,"Inside a school classroom, there is no doubt that it is hard to please everyone."
1148,a68b220b794b,"Therefor, when a student becomes disengaged from the lesson, they often become bored and fall behind in the class."
1149,a68b220b794b,"After-all, all students learn differently, so it is inevitable that some of the students will become disengaged."
1150,a68b220b794b,"However, with his new technology, Professor Huang predicts that the ""classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...then it could modify the lesson"""
1151,4f07c1f79341,"With this technology implemented, anytime a student starts to fall behind during the lesson, the computer could make slight adjustments to the teacher's plans to help redirect the student back on track."
1152,bc597f39a7ea,"It is common knowledge that the more a student falls behind in a class, the harder it becomes to catch up, which in turn makes the student fall behind even more."
1153,bc597f39a7ea,It is a viscious cycle that all stems from a day of not paying attention that could be averted by this technology
1154,d884f81d270c,This technology could also help both students and teachers in a long-term manner.
1155,d884f81d270c,"In paragraph 7 of the article, it is revealed that this new technology could ""even indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"" (Paragraph 7)."
1156,d884f81d270c,Say there is a classroom without an emotion-sensing computer.
1157,d884f81d270c,"In the classroom there is a student who, behind the fake smile is dealing with something that they cannot tackle on their own."
1158,d884f81d270c,"The teacher never notices, and the child goes on without help."
1159,d884f81d270c,Now imagine if there was a computer in that class
1160,d7505cfe5542,"Once it sensed the troubling expressions on the child's face, it could flag down the teacher and alert him or her to the students problem, resulting in the child getting the counceling he or she needs."
1161,23035c9296fe,The amount of improvement a classroom could see if this technology was implemented correctly would be immeasurable.
1162,23035c9296fe,"The system could prevent students from falling behind in class because they cannot relate to how the teacher is teaching, and the technology could see through fake expressions hiding more troubled thoughts."
1163,23035c9296fe,"With this sort of system, it may actually be possible to ""make everyone happy."""
1164,271ec6c78981,"The ""Facial Action Coding System"" is technology that can be used in the class room because some people can't figure out how good or bad someone is feeling."
1165,f29f26a0f9e4,Teachers will be able to know if the student is learning or eithor not paying attention or sleeping in class.
1166,c9ef47002565,It'll be easier for them to know what's false and what's true expression in their situation they could be in.
1167,3a09246e2edd,In difference in the situation students can't understand someone's expression.
1168,f9e7bdcd0f6f,Thanks to the technolgy now it'll be easier to figure out students emotion or anyone.
1169,00ffd72ef850,"The article states, "" Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements- in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."
1170,00ffd72ef850,"By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions."
1171,00ffd72ef850,Each expression is compared against a neutral face.
1172,00ffd72ef850,"""""The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do."""
1173,c641b2a2113b,"Finally, yes the technology is worth a big margin but its worth to have the help we can all get to help us know many."
1174,62881654075c,"In my opinion it'll be a better way to learn/read better on our emotional expressions because you""'ll have more information and could know more about everything you want or need to know about the expressions."
1175,62881654075c,"According to the Facial Feedback Theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."
1176,62881654075c,"We humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day, for instance, you can probably tell how a person is feeling simply by the look on their face."
1177,3b8ef623dfa6,The national safety council estimates that 1.4million accidents occur every year due to people using their cell phones.
1178,3b8ef623dfa6,"200,000 of those accidents alone are from texting and driving."
1179,3b8ef623dfa6,How some people believe that texting and driving needs to be closely monitored because of the risk it involves.
1180,3b8ef623dfa6,While other people think that it's alright to use your phone while driving as long as you keep glancing at the road as you are replying to your text
1181,5157df3b8808,"This negatively affects teens and their society, and should be strictly avoided."
1182,0451e6cac6f6,"Using your cell phone causes many distractions for your eyes, your mind, and your actions."
1183,23e981c3d7b6,It is easily possible for your eyes to slip off the road.
1184,23e981c3d7b6,"Therefore, instead of your eyes locking in on your phone they should be locked on watching your speed, the road and the traffic."
1185,23e981c3d7b6,"At the same time, while driving your mind can only process so much."
1186,23e981c3d7b6,"In addition, your minds need to focus on one thing while driving and that is the road."
1187,23e981c3d7b6,"Simultaneously, the usage of your phone while driving makes your unaware of the happenings that may occur on the road."

1214,6290158b60b6,make the streets safer
1215,15a90ff5a124,stop the polution of the air?
1216,00dec2023c50,Car-free cities seem to be more safe.
1217,97e8d1085fb0,Obesity is a big problem in the United States.
1218,97e8d1085fb0,"So instead of us just getting excerise of maybe 20 feet to walking to the car, and then the 45 feet to walk to where we need to go."
1219,9328b3460fe1,"Lets get rid of cars and if you need some where to go, then walk and dont be lazy and get some excerise."
1220,9328b3460fe1,"Excerise is not bad for you, and is actually very healthy."
1221,9328b3460fe1,Walking is also a good way to relieve stress and get things off your mind.
1222,9328b3460fe1,Sometimes people get mad or upset while driving adn there emotions get in the way of there driving and it ends up badly.
1223,9328b3460fe1,So if we get rid of cars it would also decrease the number of accidents.
1224,9328b3460fe1,When your walking and you get upset or mad you wont have to take it out on the car or anyone else around you.
1225,9328b3460fe1,Walking instead of driving is a better motive especially when we have a high obesity rate.

1227,ac5cb3aec0a9,"In a lot of cities and or countries, there are a lot of ""non-safe"" streets."
1228,ac5cb3aec0a9,"There are always car accidents, people dying in these car accidents, there used in some kind of violence."
1229,ac5cb3aec0a9,Car accidents are one of the most caused death.

1231,ac5cb3aec0a9,So if getting rid of cars would deffinetly dramatically decrease the number of deaths we have just by getting rid of the cars.
1232,ac5cb3aec0a9,Just think of how many lives will be saved!
1233,ac5cb3aec0a9,Most of the time thefts are not captured because they always have a run away vehicle to get a way.
1234,ac5cb3aec0a9,"If we stop using cars, what are they gonna use to get a way?"
1235,ac5cb3aec0a9,"If they try using public transportation to get away, with other people on the bus, he would look suspicious, and get caught."
1236,ac5cb3aec0a9,"The streets would be a lot safer, especially for adults that have children."

1244,6369f95398e6,"So instead of us Americans not giving a crap about what were doing to the wonderful beautiful planet we live on, we should start, and help, but not driving the things that pollute are air."
1245,53a0afc3eaec,"In a result of limiting car usage, Mr. Goldberg says "" Many experts expect public transport serving suburbs to play a much larger role."""
1246,53a0afc3eaec,"So this means that by approving it this year, there will be more public transportation then people driving there personal cars."
1247,53a0afc3eaec,Getting rid of cars would decrease a lot of the problems we have now.
1248,620f43230338,"Some of you might think, ""well what if we work for a living and need to get to work?"""
1249,06fab521a2f3,"Well, you can awlays WALK to the public transportation area."

1253,6ddb9071d916,"Getting rid of cars will decrease a lot of issues that we have in the world today, so getting rid of or decreasing the car-usage is a positive, not a negative."
1254,af23c7b9c97d,"That the author did good job at explan the evidences like he saws,"
1255,7cf73f8c112f,"""Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a veicle hovering over venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditition by staying up and ount of their way"" That it is imported to study Venus even if it dangers."
1256,e2f781c119ad,"Venus ounce look like earth, like ""Earth-like planet in our solar system"
1257,cc9426fc608a,"Long age, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."""
1258,cc9426fc608a,That it tells us that it you'st to be livible.
1259,384bc05d9775,Venus is a challenging planet to study
1260,f57661d05705,"like it saws, ""numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."""
1261,f57661d05705,Venus is a challenging to travel to even if it so close.
1262,7a796141bb24,Traveling to Venus isn't imposible
1263,8dd9a37c4025,"like it saws, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imaginatin and innovation."""
1264,8dd9a37c4025,It is posible to trave to Venus.
1265,fcd4ffe77134,"Venus is a challenging planet, that we like to study about and learn how it was formed."
1266,fd7df123f926,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it may present."
1267,fd7df123f926,The author then goes on to tell us all of his facts that back up his claim
1268,eaa0c8b8cc97,I believe the author makes a very good point.
1269,da74a38ab8b8,"In paragraph 4 the author tells us even though Venus's surface had conditions five times more extreme than what we see on Earth, long ago it was covered with large oceans, rocky sediment and craters."
1270,da74a38ab8b8,If Venus's conditions used to be so similar to Earth then could it possibly have supported life?
1271,261ed0a975d7,In paragraph 7 the author goes to tell us that scientists over at NASA have some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating Venus like conditions.
1272,de1ec5b18a04,If we can somehow develop the technology to last in Venus like conditions wouldn't it be worth it to see what mysteries it holds.
1273,de1ec5b18a04,"We have the technology at our fingertips, all we have to do is put in the time and effort to get to Venus."
1274,3eee9aceab20,limiting car usage could be a good thing for some people.
1275,3eee9aceab20,only if they like to walk and do fun things with their lives.
1276,b03ba1f18336,it saves people lots of money
1277,696fbc8373a3,"They could have bigger and better things because they wouldnt have to pay a car note, or pay for gas every week"
1278,80bca0992771,"Having a life without a car can sometimes be a bit scary exspecially if you need to do ,or be somewhere in the middle of the night ."
1279,80bca0992771,you may be ill and need a doctor immedialty you wouldnt be able to walk .
1280,573458b63e39,But lets look on the positive side we do have ambulances and things of that sort so we really dont have that much to worry about.
1281,d14d53cd1594,the most important part of this is that we have to be safe.
1282,d14d53cd1594,and do things the right way
1283,31db09e20034,I think NO cars is a good things saves me more money for shopping and the finer things in life.
1284,0cf2e9982192,i also wouldnt have to beg my parents to take me anywhere because i would be my own transportation.
1285,ead763ee2857,When does school end?
1286,ead763ee2857,It doesn't because of teachers who give students hard assignments to do over summer break.
1287,ead763ee2857,Summer projects are a fun way to engage students in learning over their 2 month break.
1288,96762aa13b6c,it should be student-designed
1289,a6696f10dc36,"let students gain leadership skills,"
1290,e7869ac1996b,let them express their creativity.
1291,47e9042e2006,One of the many needed traits in life is leadership and is gained from setting a goal and reaching it.
1292,47e9042e2006,Leadership is an important trait because it shows your character and is necessary in a workplace.
1293,47e9042e2006,An example of a student-designed project is the Science Fair.
1294,47e9042e2006,The Science Fair allows students to choose a project of their own and complete it for a grade.
1295,47e9042e2006,The Science Fair is a perfect example of successful student led projects which also help gain leadership.
1296,47e9042e2006,Another example of a student-designed project is the MYP assignment.
1297,47e9042e2006,"The MYP assignment is assigned to 10th graders, in Virginia, and are supposed to make a project from scratch."
1298,47e9042e2006,Their project is allowed to be anything they want and in any format which helps the students gain leadership skills when they finish.
1299,47e9042e2006,Important traits like leadership are gained from student-designed projects
1300,06530ba67eb7,A student that loves cars will try more on a project they designed about cars then a teacher telling them to design a project about Anatomy.
1301,06530ba67eb7,"Also, if a student knows a lot about a specific topic then it would be easier to write about it compared to a topic they have almost no knowledge of."
1302,06530ba67eb7,"For example, if I know almost everything that has to do with Poker then I would rather write about that instead of computers which I know nothing about."
1303,06530ba67eb7,"During the summer, many students will be on vacation with their families."
1304,06530ba67eb7,The summer is the one time students get a long relaxing break and are free from work.
1305,06530ba67eb7,Summer projects assigned by teachers can be stressful and confusing at times which is why it should be a student-designed project.
1306,06530ba67eb7,Students designing their own project would allow them to work on it at their own time and do it at a comfortable pace.
1307,06530ba67eb7,Creativity is an important skill which students should be allowed to express.
1308,8f0cdf12a54f,Teachers-designed projects would allow students to have a baseline of where to start from.
1309,8f0cdf12a54f,One positive of teacher-designed projects would be they are professionally designed (by the Teacher).
1310,7111ba2aa7f0,"However, many teachers assign projects without thinking of the difficulty or issues that students could face."
1311,7111ba2aa7f0,What if a student doesn't know anything about the topic?
1312,7111ba2aa7f0,Well the teachers expects them to learn it themselves which is another reason giving students the ability to choose for them self is a good idea.
1313,7111ba2aa7f0,A project designed by the teacher can take longer than they expect if students aren't fully educated about the topic.
1314,7111ba2aa7f0,"Consequently, this leads to students wasting more of their summer from trying to learn about then complete the teachers project."
1315,abe867447c00,student-designed projects are more beneficial than teacher designed projects.
1316,abe867447c00,They both have pros however the positives of student-designed projects outweigh the teachers.
1317,abe867447c00,"Projects designed by students allow them to gain leadership skills, and let them explore their curiosity or creativity."
1318,ed32b0ad1ee4,Dr. Huang stated that his computer can identify a persons feeling just by scaning them.
1319,ed32b0ad1ee4,By the way it look the computer can verify a person experssions by the way that they look even thou some poeple in this world can understand expressions but techology is change and now it can nearly tell human emotion.
1320,ed32b0ad1ee4,But yet the differences here are that the computer can see emotions or no emotions at all.
1321,5d91d88baffd,Well the step to take in order to see if a person is showing emotions it would muscular action units.
1322,5d91d88baffd,For the instruction 1&2 will determin that techology can tell which from which like a smile canbe tested by a computer or a real person.
1323,5d91d88baffd,A machine can tell the difference.
1324,1c12c96323b5,We need to look at the prons and cons cause a person can tell if a person is showing any emotion is how they are useing their mouth's muscular actions such as smiling or frowning.
1325,1c12c96323b5,Telling a force one a real smile can be que trickey but a computer can tell the differences.
1326,ec35221a0c5d,Remember in elementary school you used to get summer reading logs and checks on books you were 'required' to read during your break?
1327,ec35221a0c5d,Some students never had a problem with these types of assignments because they loved to read any chance they could get.
1328,ec35221a0c5d,"Unfortunately, there were also the kids who would dread reading and give up after ten minutes or pretend they did the entire assignment."
1329,ec35221a0c5d,"Though at this age, it really didn't matter whether or not you did the reading logs, it was just a little nudge your school would give you to do summer learning."
1330,ec35221a0c5d,"However, when students reach higher levels of school, especially around high school, the requirement of summer projects is actually a requirement."
1331,ec35221a0c5d,"Lots of students complain that it is unfair to do assignments over the one, long break they receive, but depending on the class subject it is for, sometimes these projects are essential."
1332,c5e9a723847b,"Schools must be aware that if summer projects are always going to be required, the assignments should be student-designed"
1333,d44b382522af,students will have more urge to do them
1334,3c3373b8e4c3,"sometimes the projects can interfere with summer plans, making it troublesome to get work done."
1335,a30ff3873aaa,"Summer is the only substantially long break that students receive off of homework, assignments and tests."
1336,a30ff3873aaa,"Through the months of August until June, school does not cease."
1337,a30ff3873aaa,"Almost every week, robotic-like students must wake up early Monday morning, suffer through eight hours of sitting and listen to a teacher go on about something like, why did the War of 1812 happen, how to dissect a frog, or solve for x."
1338,a30ff3873aaa,"Five days are filled with this repeating schedule with two days to spare, and in my experience one of those days is set aside for weekend homework."
1339,a30ff3873aaa,"No matter how much someone loves school and learning, eventually they need a break."
1340,a30ff3873aaa,"Summer is the time to cut loose, hang out with friends, travel somewhere you've never been before and relax."
1341,a30ff3873aaa,Almost everyone has seen in a movie how students throw their books and papers up in the air as soon as that last day bell rings.
1342,a30ff3873aaa,"Imagine receiving a final project the last day of school, requiring students to turn in on the first day of their next year of school."
1343,a30ff3873aaa,"Now if that project was teacher-designed it might require a student to: 'write an eight page essay on the effects of propaganda use in your society' or 'create a tri-fold and 3-D display of a past, indigenous, tribe's village'."
1344,a30ff3873aaa,Just picturing these assignments make some people cringe.
1345,a30ff3873aaa,"However, if summer projects were student-designed, people could create a piece of work that interests them and hopefully enables them to put in more effort on the assignment because it wouldn't feel as much like a school task"
1346,22b2ea695630,"Student-designed projects could focus on what students question or wonder about in their day to day lives, peaking their interests and making the task feel more fun and creative."
1347,22b2ea695630,"Students could receive a broad outline like 'write an essay' or 'create a display', and turn it into a unique piece that expresses themselves; something like a paper on endangered animals."
1348,18804a7dfc06,"During summer a lot of trips and vacations are taken whether with family or friends, near or far."
1349,18804a7dfc06,"Nevertheless, each one requires people to leave their homes and travel with the minimal amount necessary to save space."
1350,18804a7dfc06,"In my experience, I once was gone for almost the entire summer."
1351,18804a7dfc06,One week I was in Pennsylvania with my relatives and the next I was swimming in the crystal clear waters of the Bahamas.
1352,18804a7dfc06,"Now imagine if these vacations, no matter how long the duration, were to be taken away from students because of a teacher-designed, summer project."
1353,18804a7dfc06,"If one was to receive a project of this type, there is no way of telling how much time or the location required to get it done."
1354,18804a7dfc06,"For example, if teachers were to design a summer research paper on the history of where you live, it might be necessary to go to the public library to view history records."
1355,18804a7dfc06,No one can do that or go there if they're skiing all the way in Colorado.
1356,5a2eee6a4a3c,Student-designed projects allow students to create a work period and timing schedule for when doing the assignment works best for them.
1357,3b7fe780a3bf,"Some, especially teachers, might argue that having students design their own summer projects will lead to the minimal work necessary and a poorly done assignment."
1358,3b7fe780a3bf,"Teachers might say that students are primarily focused on their summers and just having fun, rather than getting something done that could benefit them in their next school yea"
1359,b1fac8fb8f84,"However, if the project is required for school, that typically means it is graded."
1360,b1fac8fb8f84,"Students won't try to do the least amount work possible just to save them time, if that means they will earn a D on the project."
1361,b1fac8fb8f84,They will start the year off poorly.
1362,b1fac8fb8f84,The overall effect of the project will outweigh how much time and effort is put into it.
1363,762b03efb36b,"Overall, student-designed projects would be more beneficial for both teachers and students because these types of assignments create a unique idea of who you are as a person because it shows individual interests."
1364,762b03efb36b,"If a project was deemed boring and just based on facts, teachers would be more likely to receive non creative and possibly plagiarized work."
1365,762b03efb36b,Students wouldn't care to try their best because this one task is taking time out of their long awaited break from school.
1366,762b03efb36b,"In addition, student-designed projects also allow teachers assigning them, to have a sense of who their incoming students are, based on their projects."
1367,46f58858850a,"Students across all age groups look forward to the last day of school, the day summer vacation begins."
1368,46f58858850a,"From the endless memories summer entails, to the exciting, fun experiences, summer vacation is one of the most beneficial times for students."
1369,46f58858850a,"For many high school students, teachers assign summer assignments or projects that relate to a class they may be taking in the upcoming school year."
1370,46f58858850a,These assignments tend to require an expansive amount of time and also tend to be rather ineffective.
1371,46f58858850a,In the summer students want to fill their time with exciting activities that they would enjoy.
1372,46f58858850a,"We live in the age of self exploration with some the most inquisitive students, but we still conform to the age old summer assignment system."
1373,56536c118079,"In a new modern classroom setting, students should have the liberty to design their own summer projects"
1374,eb9c9c0f803b,"because students are more inclined to learn when they have the liberty to decide their work,"
1375,92290bc34513,the process of self exploration is the key to molding successful minds.
1376,984de5a8cdd6,"When given a task you do not enjoy, most people do either of two things."
1377,984de5a8cdd6,"The first thing they do is rush the task to get it over with, and the second thing they do is push it off as much as they can."
1378,984de5a8cdd6,"Similarly, when a student is given an assignment that is not of interest to them, the quality of work is very low."
1379,984de5a8cdd6,"In reference to the summer, this general idea is heightened; a majority of students tend to push off assignments to the very latest, creating lackluster work and also not learning much from the assignment."
1380,984de5a8cdd6,"Personally, I have experienced this repeatedly."
1381,984de5a8cdd6,"When I was given a summer assignment for my English class this year, I was eager to read the book."
1382,984de5a8cdd6,"While, the book was interesting the assignment was extremely long."
1383,984de5a8cdd6,"The intended goal of the assignment was to expand the knowledge and analysis of the book, but after completing the assignment, I felt like that once held excitement and knowledge was gone."
1384,984de5a8cdd6,"If I had the ability to design my own assignment relating to the book, I most likely would have enjoyed completing the assignment, allowing for an expansion of knowledge."
1385,984de5a8cdd6,"This does not only apply to my experiences with summer assignments, but also applies to my overall experience as a student."
1386,984de5a8cdd6,"When given the liberty to decide my own work, I am not only excited to work, but I am also more dedicated."
1387,984de5a8cdd6,"When my education is in my hands, I produce some of my best work."
1388,984de5a8cdd6,"Currently as a junior enlisted in a self led research class, I have learned so much about myself and the overall topic I am researching."
1389,984de5a8cdd6,"Although at first the task at hand was daunting, I learned how to organize myself effectively and complete a thorough research project that I am happy with."
1390,984de5a8cdd6,"By having the research project on my own, I am constantly thinking about it and I spend more time to work."
1391,984de5a8cdd6,Giving students the ability to decide their course of work is one of the most beneficial decisions a teacher can make for the future of a student.
1392,425b162eb5e2,Some of the most successful people are regarded for their fame and success due to self exploration.
1393,425b162eb5e2,"In Benjamin Franklin's famous autobiography, he shares his experiences through self exploration."
1394,425b162eb5e2,"Growing up in a poor household, Franklin's father could not afford to send him to a traditional college education, but through Franklin's own personal endeavors and exploration, he became one of America's founding fathers, discovered lightning, and paved a legacy that is still remembered today."
1395,425b162eb5e2,Simple self exploration can start with these summer projects.
1396,425b162eb5e2,"When a student is given their own freedom, remarkable results can follow."
1397,425b162eb5e2,"The purpose of a curriculum is to mend our future minds into strong, independent thinkers, so by implementing simple strides of self exploration, schools and teachers are able to mold the minds of successful students."
1398,425b162eb5e2,"In my own experiences, self exploration has made a remarkable impact."
1399,425b162eb5e2,"When I was 15 I started my first company, learning everything on my own with the help of a few mentors along the way."
1400,425b162eb5e2,"Not only did I grow as a person, but my knowledge for business also grew tremendously."
1401,425b162eb5e2,"Through the use of online resources, videos, and contacts, I was able to produce something I am truly proud of."
1402,425b162eb5e2,"The work I put in, was time I wanted to because I was truly passionate about what I was doing."
1403,425b162eb5e2,That passion is what we need to strive for.
1404,425b162eb5e2,"From simple opportunities for self exploration during the summer to long term projects, as a society we need to move towards encouraging self education and self exploration."
1405,efce07da0947,"The overall benefit of students having their education in their hands, outweighs the potential negative repercussions."
1406,98ebd90f6d94,Some may predict that students may slack off when given the opportunity to create their own summer projects.
1407,3c1e34baca6e,"While this is possible, when a student is pushed, surprising results follow."
1408,3c1e34baca6e,"In addition, giving students that necessary push is how we can create a brighter future."

1428,33e13d16c0d4,In the begin in the story it talks about how she had 83 percent happy and 9 percent digusted smile and 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry.
1429,33e13d16c0d4,And that her science teacher had graded her latest lab assignment.
1430,33e13d16c0d4,And that mona lisa at least according some new computer of showing her emotions.
1431,2e6d4fa8cb4c,In the body paragraph it talks about how that you have to show your emotions.
1432,2e6d4fa8cb4c,And the neutral face showing no of there emotions.
1433,2e6d4fa8cb4c,I wonder why the neutral face does want to show emotions.
1434,2e6d4fa8cb4c,It will be good if they show emotions.
1435,2e6d4fa8cb4c,But I think that the neutral face does want to show emotions.
1436,2e6d4fa8cb4c,Becuase some people might look at them.
1437,f4f2379eb81a,In the conclusion part it talks about how you are suppose to smile.
1438,f4f2379eb81a,And putting on happy face works.
1439,f4f2379eb81a,If you make a happy face you are showing your emotions to other people.
1440,f4f2379eb81a,I think that a lot people should put on there happy face.
1441,f4f2379eb81a,Becuase they will be showing there emotions to people.
1442,f4f2379eb81a,I think that some people don't want to smile becuase they don't like to smile.
1443,f4f2379eb81a,Or they hate to smile in front of people.
1444,f4f2379eb81a,I wonder why some people don't want to smile.
1445,f4f2379eb81a,I think that some people don't want to smile in front people.
1446,f4f2379eb81a,Becuasue they are afraid to smile in front of people.
1447,7fb32bdc9d9e,Would you like to be forced to choose an extracurricular activity that you don't like?
1448,f635fc9c8c9e,The principal's idea of all students participating in at least one extracurricular activity is a bad idea
1449,3a937170491c,not every students like extracurricular activity
1450,8616e9edf70a,there are not a variety of activities to choose from
1451,8fc0cd2a86bc,some students already participates in some extracurricular activities outside of school.
1452,715f815b915c,"Extracurricular activities are not everyone's favorite, most students would rather do their school work than extracurricular activities."
1453,715f815b915c,One reason for that is the amount of work the students are receiving.
1454,715f815b915c,The teachers are giving students an extreme amount of work that the student's interest towards extracurricular activities has declined.
1455,715f815b915c,"A way to fix the problem is to make the lessons less ornate, and more simple."
1456,8e0b8232beeb,"The school has some choices for extracurricular activities such as sports, year book, and student council."
1457,8e0b8232beeb,There are not many selections that are available for them.
1458,8e0b8232beeb,"For example, if a student doesn't have a favorite choice, then they would be forced to choose something they don't favor."
1459,8e0b8232beeb,That would diminish their view towards school and the principal.
1460,8e0b8232beeb,"The school can create more choices for the students to pick from, and it could make a difference."
1461,525cbc74494c,Extracurricular activities such as swimming which is not possible to be done in school.
1462,525cbc74494c,"I think schools should focus on the main subjects such as Math, Science, and English, and not extracurricular activities."
1463,525cbc74494c,"Even if there are extracurricular activities in school, there should be a choice for it."
1464,6edcb5499be7,"In conclusion, the principal's idea of all students participating in at least one extracurricular activity is a bad idea because not every students like extracurricular activity, there are not a variety of activities to choose from, and some students already participates in an extracurricular activities outside of school."
1465,6edcb5499be7,Extracurricular activities should be a choice not a must.
1466,cc186c61fdf4,I think Luke's point of view of convincing people to go on a Seagoing Cowboy trip.
1467,3c0ce0241a7d,"The text states

Luke joined the program is it was a once in a lifetime opporortunity."
1468,3c0ce0241a7d,"The text states,Luke said why would I pass this up this is anopporortunity of a lifetime."
1469,3c0ce0241a7d,"The text alo states, he said being a Seagoing Cowboy was much more than an adventure for him it opened up the world to him."
1470,3c0ce0241a7d,Another thing Luke said is.
1471,3c0ce0241a7d,"""It makes people moreof the other countries in need."
1472,3c0ce0241a7d,"The text states,the cattle boat trip is an unbeliveable opportnity for a small town boy."
1473,3c0ce0241a7d,"The text also states,Luke said that awareness stayed with him leading his familly to host a numberofinternational students and exchange visitors for many years."
1474,3c0ce0241a7d,"The text also states,Luke found time to have fun on board, especially on the return trips after the animals had been unloaded."
1475,3c0ce0241a7d,Another thing Luke said is he was so grateful for the opportunity.
1476,3c0ce0241a7d,"The text states,Luke got to see all these different countries like china,and Europe."
1477,3c0ce0241a7d,The text also states that Luke got to tour an excavated castle in Crete.
1478,3c0ce0241a7d,Another thing that Luke said is sometimes you won't no when it will happen
1479,72d80bd63901,I agree with the claim against the value of using this technology to read student's emotional expressions.
1480,fd7ffc09bc4a,"First off, we perform these calcutions everyday, as we can tell if our friend is happy or sad by looking at their face most of the time."
1481,fd7ffc09bc4a,"Also, video imagery tells us that the facial emotions for each emotion are universal."
1482,0e863cbe6dd6,"Another big reason is that we really don't know just how much computers can do, it can be where computers detect whether you're happy or sad."
1483,75193de8c995,"Performing this calculation every day, we would have trouble describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc."
1484,75193de8c995,"However, we can also use human anatomy to help paint precisely enough to convey specific emotions."
1485,75193de8c995,New computer software has anatomical information as electronic code.
1486,75193de8c995,Video imagery which is the new emotion-recognition software which tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa.
1487,75193de8c995,The software can detect mixed emotions by weighing the different units.
1488,0b5aba2c95e3,"In a whole, this is a lot to disagree with, since computers are taking over our world now so I believe this is a great idea."
1489,0b5aba2c95e3,"Reason being is that we have video imagery, the amazing and undiscovered knowledge of a computer, and our own brains because we calculate expressions on our own every day."
1490,0b5aba2c95e3,These our all major factors that align with the fact that I believe technology should be able to read students' emotional expressions.
1491,cfa772548c4f,"In the ""German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"", there is a new district that has forbidden street parking, driveways, garages."
1492,cfa772548c4f,The residents of this upscale community are suburbans poineers.
1493,cfa772548c4f,"In france, there is one street that has a tram that runs to downtown."
1494,cfa772548c4f,The tram is only thing that drives on the road.
1495,cfa772548c4f,"there are 2 places to park, one is you park at a large garage at the end of the development , two is  to buy a space for 40,000 dallors and also a home."
1496,cfa772548c4f,70% of vauban do not own cars and 57% sold there cars.
1497,cfa772548c4f,I say they should all have cars and drive on then roads because its easier to get around and faster.
1498,cfa772548c4f,they should make deals with everyone because so everyone has a chance to drive.
1499,c4921c24f6df,", they should not use cars"
1500,cfeea3fa2a44,they would have to pay for gas
1501,c721de9acce1,people would cause accidents and get hurt or killed.
1502,0c3a23c2ec01,Cars can be very dangerous and could brake down or cause your life.
1503,b64b09c06e1f,They can be expensive and some that you can not afford.
1504,b64b09c06e1f,Cars can eat your money away just by draveling long distance and always got to check your car before you go anywhere.
1505,3bd64c3369a7,cars are apart of people lives and every day there will be a car on a road.
1506,3bd64c3369a7,the united states expanses suburban ideas about the car cultures.
1507,3bd64c3369a7,Americans are making all sorts of kind of cars and trying to build them more safer and better for the people driving them.
1508,41a34afe6a55,The Facial Action Coding System is a new descoverage of the scientifics.
1509,41a34afe6a55,This new descoverage can help in some situation.
1510,41a34afe6a55,It can help in many situations with the acception of the person.
1511,41a34afe6a55,Fothermore it could be and not helpfull used in school
1512,efac90557517,FACS can be used in school for knowladge.
1513,dcf01e7f34b7,"In school can be used for give a lesson,because it will give examples of muscles on your face,"
1514,8ef413ee3f02,for example on of them can be orbiculris.
1515,8ef413ee3f02,It can teach the kids that good to show they emotions and how they show them and how they muscles act when they do them.
1516,8ef413ee3f02,Fothermore it can show the students that they muscles not only express emotions they can make them to.
1517,741f06e649f1,Also this can help with students that have problems in they houses and they try to hide they problems
1518,1ed2e15cd4f6,It can be also used for bullying to see why kids are quiet and scared.
1519,2c76406a236c,"This experiment it can be help in differents part of the country no only in schools, it can help for example in hospitals"
1520,eabb0cb543d2,to see how the people that can't move they face or have a muscles problems can tell how they feeling
1521,f3897da24ecb,"It's always important to know how other person feel about, because if they sad or angry make them laugh so they can have a big smile in they faces."
1522,1b24924076f0,"In that work we gonna explain, give ideas and talk a little bit about the problems at the study of Venus because that planet is very dangers to survival"
1523,adde127a436e,"Though Venus is a ""sister"" of the Earth Planet is not the same, Venus is not safetly to people live in their"
1524,6cf0830530a1,because doesn't have the sufficient oxygen to survival.
1525,6cf0830530a1,Thoughthe austronomers are fascined with Venus because is the most similar planet to the Earth.
1526,6cf0830530a1,"But this planet obviusly have a differents to Earth like, the surface on Venus temperatures average over 800 degrees that is crazy and impossible to survival and in venus are present Volcanos eruptions."
1527,3a688cdcf413,"A idea for the NASA from me to send people to study the planet, is implement a new jetplane more security for thr austronomers for they can survival and can study the planet."
1528,3a688cdcf413,And a new uniform most special for the can have the capacity to survival that dangers problems at Venus.
1529,d999c6b13523,With that work we can explain and understand better about the problems with that planet and have ideas to a better study.
1530,24a9efd1355d,By the author of this topic is really persauding by true facts where it makes u think.
1531,68f96e9f4780,During all this time all the best and expert sciencetist are working together to test a method nd see if we can live on that planet without dying or not producing food or water or even shelter.
1532,16b684a34bd9,"While testing we figured out that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun."
1533,16b684a34bd9,"Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."
1534,de25de69a05a,So that is why I think during the proccess on living venus or in the future testing methods if we could live pn venus or see if we can grow crops or bring like equiment to test samples on we can evole on this planet near us.
1535,c6a4f7795d66,"Even the thought of going to a new planet is a big turn of events because we dont know how its atmosphere works or gravity or air/oxygen or weather climate change or anything but we are learning about it really fast where we have to make a high expert group of people to risk their lives to see if we can produce our species or our tech,food,citys, or even animal life"
1536,fec42e4977a1,in conculsion to make sure that we sure we dont make the smallest mistake to screw up the plans for us to live or visit venus in future but in mean time we have people training to become the best of the best for this secret peoject if it happens.
1537,fec42e4977a1,So that is all i gotta say and i hope it does happen to make history on the board for people to live on a new generation.
1538,fec42e4977a1,"So our main goal is all about Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."
1539,fec42e4977a1,Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.
1540,fec42e4977a1,Even NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus.
1541,fec42e4977a1,"For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venuss surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."
1542,fec42e4977a1,Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers
1543,0965b6fcca6f,limting use of aoto-mobiles can help change the envierment
1544,059fe79384a4,just simply slow down the use of them
1545,6dc198c1188b,simply make green cars
1546,f3a4e205bce4,which has great gass mileage and keeps the enviorment clean.
1547,f3a4e205bce4,"Now some people are atill going to drive there big gas sputering cars around but only a few percent of people change how long you drive or what you drive it can really make a differnce on the world to day you could possiable be saving the next generation

So to all those who agree with me buy a green car or stick with your but drive less often there are other ways to get around without use of a car or motercycle there are bicycles roller scates scooters just to name a few and they also help you get in shape."
1548,ef1dc4d83f56,If you dont agree with me then why are you still reading go hop on your envirment killing machiens and ruin our lovely home called earth.
1549,3043c3d4bb98,"First of all, I feel like it's pretty reliable,"
1550,4d63277151ef,"BUT one of the parts that threw me off was when Professer Nicu Sebe said that shes ""83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry."""
1551,d4ffcca06f04,Professer Nibu said the process begins when the computer construts a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.
1552,d4ffcca06f04,"Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."
1553,d4ffcca06f04,"Then his friend Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologists such as Dr. Paul Eckman, the creator of FAC (Facial Action Coding)."
1554,d4ffcca06f04,"Dr Huang then observed that ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal, even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression."""
1555,e12660b040d3,"By using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks the facial movements in either or real face or painted picture of Mona Lisa."
1556,e12660b040d3,"By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions, each expression is compared against a neutral face."
1557,e12660b040d3,"In fact, Dr. Huang said that we humans perform the same impressive calculation everyday, like for instance, me going to one of my close friends and seeing them frowning I will assume that they're upset about something."
1558,511e2758dc5a,"According to the machine if you frown at it, the next ad will be different."
1559,80edf8211362,"I feel like a machine like this would be very useful for computers so they can track if a student is getting distracted, tired or bored, because I feel like it could give the student a warning or something to not fall asleep during a test."
1560,c91ae1ac4e72,"And lastly, no, the expirement didn't really make me happy, I tried smiling and it felt awkward."
1561,e5a06bcdc827,"According to the ""Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion"" moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but it may even help producethem in a way,"
1562,00248c5ce57a,which was very shocking to me because I never knew anything could work like that.
1563,00248c5ce57a,"Reading this article made me feel smarter in a way, learning something I've never heard or seen before"
1564,5da15662bc30,But in conclusion I feel as if this article is helpful and should be seen to my peers.
1565,a565db498e4f,"They caluclate Mona Lisa emotional they said that she has 83 percent of happyness, 9 percent of disgusted, 6 percent of fearful and 2 percent angry."
1566,a565db498e4f,The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscels in the model must move like human muscles then Dr. Hung relies on the work of psychologists such as Dr. Paul Eckman creator of FACS ( facial action coding system).
1567,a565db498e4f,For example your frontails parslterails muscle ( above your eye) raises your eyebrows when you're suprised; your orbicularis oris ( around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger.
1568,a565db498e4f,In a classroom computer could recognize when student is becoming confused or bored at the same time technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery.
1569,a565db498e4f,When feeling down look in the mirror and do these falling steps 1. rasie your lips at the corners of your mouth.
1570,a565db498e4f,2. then squit your eyes slightly to prduce wrinkling ( crow's feet) at the corners of your eyes.
1571,a565db498e4f,3. holding that rasie the outer parts of your cheeks up toward your eyes that you smiling as a reowned drama coach constantin stanislvsky had his actors carefully reproduce smiling and frowning as a way of creating these emtions on stage and watching your loves one die will make you cry its the same way watching a movie of someone dieing.
1572,652c5cf012cc,I feel like that the use of the emotional expressions of students in a class room is not good.
1573,f2257406b14c,First of all it is not 100% offical
1574,700e99e89ff6,Second of all it could fill you computer with viruses.
1575,6f294c4e5b7e,last one is that it could be a lot of money to get in and most likly to fix it.
1576,6f294c4e5b7e,"It is a lot of work getting one of those and the thing is why buy it or even consider it, if it is not offical."
1577,90deb85bcf3f,The facial action coding system is not totaly offical.
1578,0f3ad1c8d4c4,In the story it says that it uses you face to tell what going on or something.
1579,0f3ad1c8d4c4,They say that they can tell if it is a real smile or a fake one by your muscules.
1580,0f3ad1c8d4c4,"The muscles called orbicularis make croe's feet around your eyes, but then a fake smile, the mouth is streched sidesways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle called the risorius."
1581,0f3ad1c8d4c4,Then is said that if an ad pops up and you are happy then the facial action coding system is going to think you like it then more and more are going to be poping up.
1582,0f3ad1c8d4c4,Sense it said that it can tell eveything just by four face.
1583,0f3ad1c8d4c4,The rusults won't be right.
1584,0f3ad1c8d4c4,For people that wear makeup the facial action coding system is not going to get the right results.
1585,0f3ad1c8d4c4,You might have a facial problem or something wrong with you muscles.
1586,0f3ad1c8d4c4,That you wouldn'd be able to simle perfectly.
1587,0f3ad1c8d4c4,Then it will give you wrong results
1588,2f783dfa9868,The fact that facial action coding system is basiclly thinking and telling you how to feel it doesn't really know what you really feel.
1589,1813fe468ae8,I feel like sense the camera is always going to just be watching you to see what you are feeling that is creepy.
1590,1813fe468ae8,Like it said it if thinks your happy when an ad pops up it's going to pull up more and more ads and you might even get a virus.
1591,1813fe468ae8,It is going to end up making some damages to your computer.
1592,1813fe468ae8,Most likely people are not going to feel safe.
1593,1813fe468ae8,What if someone gets to hack you computer.
1594,1813fe468ae8,"They are going to be watching you all day, everyday."
1595,951ec2c22e4c,Sense it said that it will cost a lot of money to get it.
1596,951ec2c22e4c,I won't be fair if some schools have it and if some don't.
1597,ee4f8da8e1fe,The facial action coding system will be hard to get.
1598,ee4f8da8e1fe,Some school can just get enough for the basic's.
1599,ee4f8da8e1fe,If they can't even get enought to get one what if is stops working or something goes wrong.
1600,ee4f8da8e1fe,The people are going to have to find more moeny just ot fix it.
1601,ee4f8da8e1fe,"Most likely, they are going to have to stop doing some clubs or some after school activities thing like that."
1602,ee4f8da8e1fe,Just to try to afford the moeny to fix the program.
1603,6c213c5ec564,Computers can do many things for us.
1604,6c213c5ec564,The idea that a computer can read your emotions is amazing
1605,8cb9d52e5dd6,I do not belive it is true.
1606,8cb9d52e5dd6,I will believe it when I see it.
1607,92d390222e7b,"In paragraph 8 it says "" But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sideways ising the zygomatic major and different muscle, the risorius."""
1608,92d390222e7b,however this may be true for most people; there has to be someone out there in our world of 7 billion that smiles there smiles with their zygomatic muscle or their risorius muscle
1609,9cf5c25d26c7,Everyone has diffrent emotions and everyone shows them diffrently
1610,750d9f876e06,The muscles in our face does say a lot about the emotions we are feeling.
1611,d416222c15dc,"I do belive to understand ones emotions it has to be very clear someone is sad, with tears, or you know the person well, In paragraph 5 the artical states "" For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on their face."""
1612,fe3cad0ebbb4,"In paragraph 3 it brings up ""Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, suprised, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"""
1613,12c7bd242708,but there are way more than 6 emotions that can be reconized
1614,e0b67c3f7664,This is why I believe computures can not read your emotions
1615,edffcb0abddb,Luke wanted to be a Seagoing Cowboy.
1616,edffcb0abddb,A cattle boat came up and gave him the opportunity to be in the Seagoing Cowboy program.
1617,edffcb0abddb,Luke's friend inited him to go on the cattle boat because his friend knew he wanted to be on one.
1618,edffcb0abddb,Luke's life changed right after graduation.
1619,edffcb0abddb,Luke did not know his life would change soon.

1624,edffcb0abddb,"Luke also found time on board, especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded."
1625,edffcb0abddb,"Luke said "" It made more aware of people of other countries and their needs."""
1626,edffcb0abddb,Then awareness stayed with him.
1627,edffcb0abddb,The cowboys played beseball and volleyball games on board when Luke was on.
1628,edffcb0abddb,There was plenty of games they played on board.
1629,edffcb0abddb,Helping at his aunt Katie's farm as a boy had prepared him is what the paragrph said so what it is saying is when he was little then he went to his aunt Katie's farm and played around and it helped him with his future with animals.
1630,df4050e115ac,"For students, summer projects can feel like a lot, summer break is supposed to be filled with fun times and vacations while projects are almost the exact opposite."
1631,df4050e115ac,"Removing summer projects all together isnt an option,"
1632,e6be044be148,"so when it comes to the question ""should summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed"" teacher-designed projects reign supreme, as it benefits both the student and the teacher in multiple different ways."
1633,a7388b24b94f,"As a teacher, your main job is proving students with a learning experience that will help them grow as people."
1634,a7388b24b94f,Having a student design a summer project would not be nearly as powerful as the impact a teacher-designed project would.
1635,172974386dd1,Teachers are well informed and know a lot more than most students and because of this it is their responsibility to provide a student with a project rather then have them create one themselves.
1636,172974386dd1,"This is especially reinforced in younger children, such as grades k-6, as they still need a lot of direction and having a student-designed project would not be as viable or coherent as a teacher-designed project."
1637,9e689c66b257,"Teachers have it difficult sometimes, as they are trying their best to provide students with a learning experience, but teachers also deserve to have their job be a little easier"
1638,efee4263f461,"Creating a teacher-designed project as opposed to a student-designed one, would be far easier to grade and create a rubric for"
1639,f0ab4586af84,.
1640,f0ab4586af84,"In student-designed projects you have a lot of variety and no one follows a central guideline, however in a teacher-designed project, you can maintain the variety but also contain a set of rules that benefits both the students and teachers, as the students have more clearly defined rules to guide and provide structure to their projects."
1641,f0ab4586af84,"This also benefits the teachers, as they can easily grade the assignment and provide a fair grading experience."
1642,df0681b1771f,"Finally, teachers have everyone's best interest at heart when designing projects."
1643,df0681b1771f,Teachers will always design something challenging and beneficial to the students education.
1644,dd27b9c0336b,"Students, especially younger ones, cannot be trusted to design a project that would be as beneficial as a teacher-designed project."
1645,dd27b9c0336b,"Students often take shortcuts or the easy way out and while sometimes this can be beneficial to the students and their education, it is more often harmful then doing it the right way and teaches them to be lazy."
1646,dd27b9c0336b,"A teacher-designed project on the other hand, would be designed with the thoughts of providing an enriching experience to the student and hopefully making them a more successful and educated person."
1647,ec0a648bf7c6,"Teachers play well informed, and important roles in a students life while they develop, and education is a very big part of student development so, projects should be designed with a teachers interests at heart."
1648,ec0a648bf7c6,"Because of that, when it comes down to it, teacher-designed projects are generally more helpful, easier, and responsible then a student-designed project would be."
1649,c011fa1feaf7,"I feel like I am for the value of this use of technology, because you can calculate other peoples facial emotions and your facial movements."
1650,8e6ac3f9c82b,I feel like if you can calculate emotions on a persons face you could understand that person better and what there feeling.
1651,ec07e6ffe34e,You could do a 3-D model of the face and put in all of the muscles just like a human has on their face.
1652,ec07e6ffe34e,"You could understand if their happy, suprised, or even sad."
1653,ec07e6ffe34e,Your frontalis pars lateralis muscles ( above the eyes ) raises your eyebrows when your suprised or scared.
1654,ec07e6ffe34e,Your emotions could be all over the place.
1655,ec07e6ffe34e,You could have certian facial expressions.
1656,ec07e6ffe34e,"For an example, you could have your fear look."
1657,ec07e6ffe34e,You could've saw something that you're afraid of and have a fear look.
1658,ec07e6ffe34e,The software could even identify mixed emotions.
1659,ec07e6ffe34e,Each expression is compared against a neutral face.
1660,ec07e6ffe34e,"I know that everyone has different facial features, but some people have the same facial expressions."
1661,ec07e6ffe34e,I personally think that we should all have different facial features because no one can be the same and no one is perfect.
1662,0d8a026f5b45,This technology could observe how our face is formed in the future.
1663,b8fc136de6aa,"This new technologyis the same technology for making computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or surgery. """
1664,b8fc136de6aa,"Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication "" that Dr. Huang had."
1665,b8fc136de6aa,"Computured need to understand that, too "" said Dr. Huang."
1666,b8fc136de6aa,Your personal computer can't handle the complex of the algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile.
1667,0662a80017a8,"You sometimes has to ask yourself

"" Does your expression in the mirror suggest an emotion?"""
1668,0662a80017a8,"and "" Can your lab partner recognize which one? """
1669,0662a80017a8,So I think that this technology is a good idea.

1678,d9e071f47769,For future visits NASA has came up with an idea to has hover crafth that floats 30 or so miles so we wouldn't have to step on the boiling planet.
1679,5939f4967636,Venus is a worthy pursuit because the more we know about our sister planet the more things we get to do with it.

1752,b268a5cdbe72,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents"
1753,2a0276ca69cb,because In the text it states that venus is actually a planet and venus is the second planet from the sun.
1754,2a0276ca69cb,The text also states that venus is simple to see from a far distant.
1755,2a0276ca69cb,"Finally, it says that numerous factors contribute to venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study in etc."
1756,2a0276ca69cb,If you look back in paragraph 1& 2 that's where I got all the information from to support my answer.
1757,916d7ff46b41,In conclusion studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because if you just reread everything in this passage it's basically telling you alot of information about venus.
1758,916d7ff46b41,"If you look back in the passage in read paragraph 8 it's giving you information about venus it says that venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."
1759,916d7ff46b41,The last in final thing is that our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.
1760,916d7ff46b41,So that basically tells you everything about why studying is a worthy pursuit despite for venus.
1761,77e0ed938496,There are many dangers that come along with studying planets.
1762,77e0ed938496,"Along with the dangers, there are also countless benefits to learning more about different planets."
1763,77e0ed938496,"In the passage, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author addresses the point that Venus is worth taking a closer look at and focusing on, no matter the dangers it could put one in."
1764,b00f58b5d941,"Although many people believe that the author doesn't support this idea well, the author provides researched evidence and past experiences all throughout the passage to support this idea."
1765,e24a1a6ee50f,"In, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author includes well researched evidence to support the idea that Venus is worthy of studying further."
1766,2cd53d75a9e7,"When explaining NASA's ideas on sending humans to Venus, the author states, ""NASAs possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."""
1767,2cd53d75a9e7,This provides evidence that shows what a solution is to avoiding some of the difficulties that occur when trying to explore Venus.
1768,2cd53d75a9e7,The author was able to support his idea throught the use of NASA and it's research.
1769,2cd53d75a9e7,"The passage continues to come up with a plan on the best way to float above Venus when the author says, ""At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."""
1770,2cd53d75a9e7,This factual evidence that is included ensures that the author is supporting this idea to the fullest of his potential.
1771,2cd53d75a9e7,Researched and factual evidence that is provided all throughout the passage shows how the author supports this idea thoroughly and well.
1772,7b369889decf,The also supports his idea of studying Venus depsite the dangers because he includes past experiences that make this idea stronger.
1773,b526ae19cda4,"When explaining past explorations to Venus, the author states, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."""
1774,b526ae19cda4,Facts that have been presented that occured in the past help the author support his idea that there is reasons why people should look into further studying Venus.
1775,b526ae19cda4,"These past facts present the idea that Venus once looked like Earth did, and if that is true, there are reasons why it should be looked into further."
1776,330b457f1916,"The passage later explains examples of NASA's approached to studying Venus when the author says, ""Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers."
1777,330b457f1916,"These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II."""
1778,330b457f1916,The idea of looking back on past resources to help the studying of Venus would help the process.
1779,330b457f1916,This past project is a key tool that helps support that Venus should be studied even though it can be extremely dangerous.
1780,330b457f1916,Using past experiences such as the ones included helps support and grow the authors idea.
1781,3896374f1a2d,"Ultimatley, it is understandable why one would believe that it isn't smart to look into studying and experimenting with Venus; however, the examples of the researched facts and past experiences help to support the authors idea that despite the dangers, Venus is worthy of studying."
1782,3896374f1a2d,"There may be many dangers that come along with studying different planets, but based off the evidence the author provided, Venus has avoidable ways to make it safe to study."
1783,2eb1f2826dba,"As the end of a school year comes to a close, the summer is just beginning."
1784,2eb1f2826dba,Many during summer use it as a time to have fun and take a break from school.
1785,2eb1f2826dba,Some schools though require students to complete a summer project to ensure learning continues throughout the year.
1786,2eb1f2826dba,This can help to make sure that the student mind is awake and ready to learn when the start of the new school year begins.
1787,794f175c3677,The basis for summer projects to assure continuous learning should be student-designed
1788,804f6ad93bea,creative projects would be produced
1789,7b41031e96e8,it would give students an opportunity to take control of their education.
1790,703751d0fe85,"During the school year, students go from class to class completing the required work to excel."
1791,703751d0fe85,"In most cases, this requires sitting through a lecture followed by an activity and homework."
1792,703751d0fe85,All of which are teacher-designed.
1793,703751d0fe85,"For this reason, summer projects should be student-designed."
1794,a9b9ef30ef18,Student-designed projects would give students the opportunity to take control of their education
1795,4c826de5c946,Students would learn the responsibility of completing a project without a teacher telling them the process they should follow.
1796,4c826de5c946,The students would have to research and create a project based on something that they are passionate about.
1797,4c826de5c946,"For example, every student has their own interest such as baking, rocketry, and architecture."
1798,4c826de5c946,"With student-designed summer projects, each student can complete their own individualized project based on their own interests."
1799,4c826de5c946,As to where a teacher-designed project the student has to go with what the teacher assigns.
1800,4c826de5c946,"If the teacher is interested in types of frogs, students would have to complete a project based on the interest of the teacher."
1801,4c826de5c946,Student-designed summer projects would give students the opportunity to take control of their education.
1802,6f003225b4d6,"When a teacher assigns a project, there are strict guidelines on how the project should be completed."
1803,6f003225b4d6,"To combat the harsh guidelines, a student-designed project would create more creative projects."
1804,58c5fd29394a,"For example, if there are 20 students in a class with one teacher and the teacher assigns a project, there will be 20 of the same project that return because of the guidelines that the teacher established when creating the project."
1805,58c5fd29394a,"But if every one of the 20 students got to design their own project, there will be 20 different projects that come back to be presented."
1806,58c5fd29394a,This will happen because the students will feel more personally connected to their project.
1807,58c5fd29394a,Students won't feel as if it is a project the teachers gave them but rather something fun to do over the summer.
1808,58c5fd29394a,"Having a summer project that is designed by an individual, the teacher, for a group, the students, will create a detriment to creativity."
1809,9d5d750663ce,"Some may argue that if summer projects were teacher-designed, then the teachers could regulate and prepare the students better for the upcoming school year."
1810,093876054001,"This may be true, but considering that throughout the normal school year teachers design and assign work to students, it would be more beneficial to give students the opportunity to learn how to take charge of their own work."
1811,6d4f2c45fbbb,Continuing to have teachers dictate the types of projects students complete year round will not prepare them for the world.
1812,6d4f2c45fbbb,A student-designed project would prepare students better for the world.
1813,eebd97587f37,"Once the students enter the world, there won't always be a teacher telling them how to complete the task assigned to them."
1814,eebd97587f37,Giving students the opportunity to experience independence over the summer is a perfect way to prepare them for the world.
1815,eebd97587f37,Preparing students for the world out of school is more important than preparing them for a few weeks in the future when school starts.
1816,d5a1e29d74cc,Schools that require students to complete a summer project should make the projects student-designed.
1817,d5a1e29d74cc,"Student-designed projects would cause for more creative projects compared to teacher-designed projects, and it would give students the opportunity to take charge of their education."
1818,d5a1e29d74cc,Having summer projects to insure students continuous learning is a terrific way to enhance a students education.
1819,d5a1e29d74cc,"But done incorrectly, it can cause a student to dread school more."
1820,d5a1e29d74cc,"A well executed summer project would be student-designed, where the student gets to decide on their own project based on an interest of their liking."
1821,d5a1e29d74cc,Making sure that students are positively active in their education is crucial to developing a well rounded individual.
1822,9821e52919d4,intro: Today ill be telling you the pros and cons about having this technology in our schools from counslers being able to tell whats with the student to invading the privacy of what we humans have to preventng suicide and to be able to maybe stop someone from commiting suicide or knowing someone is going through depression.
1823,925d6539bda7,body: so me personally think this would be some great technology to have in our schools
1824,cb3f67486973,espically for consoulers so say someone is really sad and depressed but they are to scared to open up about how they feel or whats going so you put the computer on there face and it shows they are depressed sad and scared well now you know how your student is feeling
1825,15eb2902e184,so then you cheer them up and work to make things better you dont know it but you just saved a life because who knows weather or not that student was about to comit suicide or say someone was threatned and they will not tell you that so they act like there fine but you put the computer on them and it shows that they are scared now you know they are scared and can try to work with them to open up
1826,302b5d8ce097,but from other people perspectives i can totally see how this is a total invading of privacy because we all have secrects and we dont want people knowing if were depressed or sad and alot of people dont like to communicate or open with anyone and also what if things get passed around about you being depressed the generatin today are bullys so i can see someone making fun of someone for being depressed.
1827,7a349a0b9135,"conclusion: inconclusion i think it would be some great technology to have in our schools just think about how many lives we can change or how many lives we can save by just knowing how the person next to you is feeling it would save a lot of time trying to get the person to tell you whats wrong when you can just take a picture of there face so yes i do think it would be great because itll make life better, you would save more time, and you could change alot of lives and save alot of lives with this type of technology."

1933,de5ee9634031,"Across the nation, nearly 98% of schools have offered extracurricular activities for their students, but less than half of that 98% have mandated participating in one."
1934,de5ee9634031,"In many schools worldwide, extracurriculars have been known to both help and hurt students - they can lead to staying up late making up for lost time, or they can lead to winning awards and even scholarships."
1935,39aee3524bc4,I believe that all students should be required to participate in extracurricular activities.
1936,ec3cb26ba093,mandating that students participate in after school activities could improve kids' work ethic.
1937,af984b22641a,"a study titled ""Extracurriculars and Students"" by Professor James Wood at UVA proves this."
1938,af984b22641a,"Wood found that 65% of students who participated in extracurriculars said they enjoyed the additional challenges that were presented to them, and actually continued to work harder and challenge themselves not only in their education, but also in the workforce."
1939,af984b22641a,This means that teens and kids who entered after school clubs and sports teams worked harder and were able to learn how to overcome obstacles and challenges.
1940,af984b22641a,This also goes to show how students that entered extracurricular activities did indeed improve their work ethic.
1941,af984b22641a,"In general, I think you'l find that this is important because it shows how adolescents were able to benefit from after school activities."
1942,0acaccee9bc3,requiring students to join extracurricular activities could help students get into better colleges.
1943,4a61b22e8888,a statement released by Harvard University said that 80% of colleges look for (and accept) students who participated in one or more extracurricular activities.
1944,4a61b22e8888,"To put it simply, after school activities have been known to assist students in getting into better schools."
1945,4a61b22e8888,This relates because it shows how kids and teens who entered after school activities could manage getting into excellent colleges and create a better future for themselves.
1946,4a61b22e8888,This matters due to how it shows that extracurriculars can broaden the horizon for students.
1947,22be38aa2b5d,It's actually been shown that clubs and teams could improve a students' health.
1948,ef788cbd50a8,"A professional from Johns Hopkins said in an interview, ""...Students who participated in activities after school were reported to have a better attitude, more motivation in and outside of school, and possessed an overall healthier lifestyle than their peers who did not join any extracurriculars."""
1949,ef788cbd50a8,"In other words, adolescents who joined activities after school tended to be in better condition than those who decided not to participate in any clubs or join any sports teams."
1950,ef788cbd50a8,This displays how students have been able to thrive and even better themselves thanks to extracurriculars.
1951,ef788cbd50a8,"Overall, I think you'll find this important because it shows how kids and teens can greatly benefit from after school activities."
1952,78f30ab7c08c,"some might argue that students should not be mandated to take part in extracurricular activities, and say that teens may already have a ""full plate"" and thus become stressed"
1953,b13b8d1c4c1f,A statistic from the Teens and Mental Health Welfare Society revealed that 48% of students who participated in after school activities reported an increase in stress levels.
1954,b13b8d1c4c1f,"To put it differently, close to half of the kids they talked to felt stressed due to their extracurriculars."
1955,b13b8d1c4c1f,This also demonstrates how a few students are actually pressured by their after school activities.
1956,b13b8d1c4c1f,"Ultimately, extracurricular activities may stress students."
1957,9f1b23528219,"While that might be true, there's no denying that after school activities can also teach kids to lessen their stress by learning to budget their time"
1958,3c75960630da,"In fact, I personally was able to learn how to budget my time between school, family, friends, and extracurriculars."
1959,3c75960630da,"While I did have a lot on my plate at first, my extracurriculars like sports, newspaper, and a few of my other hobbies enabled me to learn how to equally set aside time to complete all of my tasks in a timely manner, and still have time to relax."
1960,3c75960630da,"To put it in an alternate way, my after school activities were able to teach me an important skill that I'd be able to use for many years to come."
1961,3c75960630da,"You'll see that this shows that, truly, extracurriculars can teach students how to budget their time effectively."
1962,3c75960630da,"Ultimately, my extracurricular activities taught me an important life skill that could benefit me in many area of my life."
1963,23bae6306ab5,"In the end, I think that we should mandate participating in extracurriculars, as it could improve kids' work ethic, assist students in getting into good colleges, and even keep them healthy."
1964,23bae6306ab5,"Imagine a school with no after school clubs or teams offered to students; kids would be bored, unhappy to go to school with no chance to socialize or get active, and, most importantly, no chance to broaden their horizon and truly reach their full potential."
1965,89554ddc22e1,Do you remember the summer projects that you had to do during summer break?
1966,89554ddc22e1,"Even now as fewer places require summer projects for all class,they are still an important thing for both students and teachers."
1967,89554ddc22e1,They allow both so see how the other is either by teaching style or how they did on the content.
1968,cec88a31dcf3,The summer projects should be teacher designed
1969,c81b32b22872,it gives the teacher a chance to gauge the students academic level
1970,27ca36a0bda2,base it on what they will be learning that year
1971,9a6b9a33d90a,and learn the learning style of students.
1972,614cd99fec55,Some say that student designed summer projects are better because they allow the student to pick something that they find interesting and that they understand.
1973,a2c4308dd1bf,And while it may be good that the student is interested in the topic they are working on it sort off defeats the purpose of the project.
1974,a2c4308dd1bf,Because the projects are suppose to be a introduction into the next year and a way for the teacher to learn about the students
1975,655dee8bcbf1,"A student who is knowable able about history may design a project about Ancient Egypt,but if they already know the topic,they aren't learning anything."
1976,655dee8bcbf1,And while having the students create the projects may allow for more originality in the type and topic of them.
1977,655dee8bcbf1,That dosen't give the teacher the view of the student that they are meant to give teachers.
1978,655dee8bcbf1,Most students will design the project if given the chance to be easy so that they can have a good grade to start the year out.
1979,655dee8bcbf1,"But that dosen't let the teacher see their strength and weakness,and the puts them at a disadvantage because the teacher wont know were the need help till it might be to late."
1980,655dee8bcbf1,"If a student knows they have an English timed writing in Ms. Generic_Name class when they get into school,and they get to pic the book they analyze for it."
1981,655dee8bcbf1,They will pick and book probably that is on the easier side and that they understand.
1982,655dee8bcbf1,"But if they are assigned a book by Ms. Generic_Name, she can see what skills they need when they do the writing."
1983,6c1d9b65465f,Teacher-designed summer projects allow teachers to gauge students academic level on various topics.
1984,a5d11fe804cd,The teacher can create different problems bases on different levels of understanding to see which students get what level.
1985,a5d11fe804cd,This allows them a more direct view then viewing grades or passed assignments because the students may have improved since that was done.
1986,a5d11fe804cd,Once the teacher can see what academic level the students are on it allows them to create curriculum that allows everyone to understand and be successful during their class.
1987,a5d11fe804cd,"If Mr. Generic_Name has a majority of people in his algebra 2 class that dont understand functions,he might spend some more time on the basics since a majority of the year will be using functions of some sort."
1988,a5d11fe804cd,It also allows them to see who might need extra help in a subject and who can do it by them selves.
1989,980414e30e59,eacher designed summer projects also allow teachers to give a glimpse into the years curriculum.
1990,c39c887fd182,Students can get a glimpse into the curriculum of the year from teacher designed summer projects because they can insert preassesment questions to get a handle on prior knowledge or have questions that tie ideas from the previous year into the new one.
1991,c39c887fd182,"For example,Mr."
1992,c39c887fd182,Generic_Name could put in a questions about the cold war to see what people know.
1993,c39c887fd182,If a majority of the class has an understanding they can spend less time on that during the year and more on areas they are more shaky on.
1994,c39c887fd182,English and Math teachers can have problems were they have student uses old methods to solve new types of problems.
1995,c39c887fd182,This allows them to see if they need to spend more time on the basics before moving on to more advanced topics.
1996,76957413823c,Teacher designed summer projects in addition allow teachers the ability to see the students learning style and learn them.
1997,345f01221680,Teachers can see the learning style of students by including different types of questions bases on different learning styles.
1998,345f01221680,"In the projects,they design they could included questions that appeal to visual learners as well as topics that appeal to mental learners."
1999,345f01221680,"In math and science,they can included different ways of getting to the solution to see which way the student do the best on."
2000,345f01221680,This allows the teacher to create assignments that cater to the students.
2001,345f01221680,Since every batch of students is different this allows the teacher to change their curriculum to fit the students they have this year so that they can leave successful and ready for what ever next.
2002,345f01221680,"Not all years are going to be the same, Ms. Generic_Name might have a bunch of auditory learners one year but the next she has a bunch of tactile learners and if she designs her projects to look for that."
2003,345f01221680,She can plan accordingly and change her style a little so the students still leave her class successful.
2004,0e71caa5c79e,Those are some of the reasons schools should have Teacher designed summer projects.
2005,0e71caa5c79e,"Schools should have their summer projects be designed by teachers because it allows the teacher to gauge students understanding of principles and topics,allows introduction of new material,and learn learning styles."
2006,0e71caa5c79e,All schools that do summer projects should allow Teachers to designed them because that will help the year go better for both the teacher and student.
2007,a60f8be7b0a6,What the author was suggesting when he was saying venus is dangerous but a worthy pursuit.
2008,5e81eae53b78,Was that no spacecraft survived more that a couple of hours on venus.
2009,f36f06125781,The atmosphere was dangerous to people.
2010,1b0b4c81942c,It has the hottest surface temperature.
2011,1e05a80c7883,you cant go onto Venus
2012,2a9c2c3b8861,no spacecraft lasted more than a couple of hours on Venus.
2013,96ae918d179f,If a spacecraft couldn't survive on Venus there is no way that a human can survive.
2014,c9703d74c226,The second reason that man cannot be on Venus is because the atmosphere is dangerous to humans.
2015,c28db01abb67,The atmosphere is almost 97 percent cardon dioxide.
2016,c28db01abb67,Which is deadly to humans.
2017,c28db01abb67,Its like being trapped in an small airtight box with no holes.
2018,6dfb2b5d373b,The last reason that humans can't be on Venus is because it also has the hottest surface temperature of all the planets.
2019,9cd1c9cd3014,"While also having many active volcanoes, earthquakes and more frequent lightning strikes."
2020,e9ad7d0b5e7c,"So in conclusion no human can last very long on Venus, making it interesting but hard to research do to that no spacecraft survived more that a couple of hours on Venus."
2021,e9ad7d0b5e7c,The atmosphere is dangerous to people.
2022,e9ad7d0b5e7c,It has the hottest surface temperature.
2023,f21dbbb78d56,Everyone seems to believe that the face on mars was created by Aliens.
2024,f21dbbb78d56,They say that the scientists are wrong by saying it was a natural landform.
2025,f21dbbb78d56,"But, do they actually do research like the scientists do?"
2026,bedc8a855ff5,"There are many reasons that the face on mars is just a lanform,"
2027,76fcb3cd69c7,"First off, when NASA's Vicking one spacecraft was just circling and roaming around it came across something unexpecting."
2028,7251ceab98cd,"By snapping a few pictures, they believed it was a face."
2029,7251ceab98cd,"Later, when it was revealed to the world, people believed that aliens had made that mark on mars."
2030,7251ceab98cd,"The texts says, that no one has past over that ""face"" in awhile."
2031,7251ceab98cd,So how come a few pictures identify a face by using one camera?
2032,7251ceab98cd,So that's when scientist decided to investigate the face on mars.
2033,f4277a5169d7,"After scientists did a little research on their own, ""The Face"" turned out to actually be a messa that is common around the american west."
2034,673991af8d35,How can that be?
2035,673991af8d35,"Well, i will expect no one to believe that because for 25 years it was known as the face on mars."
2036,673991af8d35,Scientists had to travel up to space by Mars and snap several pictures of the face.
2037,673991af8d35,After they did their research collected thir data it came out to be a landform.
2038,bc5b31177611,Some say that the scientists used a digital three image camera.
2039,56d17c1cb672,What's the difference its just a camera
2040,06ceda39586a,"Well, that camera captured the truth about mars."
2041,06ceda39586a,"For proof, if you looked online you can actually see what was really there."
2042,b49bfd0dde0d,Even NASA's spacecraft revealed it to be a messa.
2043,b49bfd0dde0d,"So, it was just a false staement."
2044,b49bfd0dde0d,"There was no alien monument, in the first place."
2045,b49bfd0dde0d,So for 25 years the face on Mars was actually a messa.
2046,b49bfd0dde0d,But NASA would rather hide the truth about what they saw.
2047,b49bfd0dde0d,"So until, it's revealed as an actual face, it will be known as a messa or some peopel still say it's the face of Mars."
2048,0c355f2ab00f,"So with that all said, the face turned out to be a messa."
2049,0c355f2ab00f,"So with the actual data, everyone should know that it is a messa."
2050,0c355f2ab00f,"So wa sthe face really created by aliens, no it was not."
2051,0c355f2ab00f,It was really a landform.
2052,9d0c6f1e0db4,"Creativity is the heart of our current society, when given the opportunity those who have the ability to think outside the box create unimaginably beautiful things."
2053,9d0c6f1e0db4,In schools students arent given the opportunity to be as creative as they could be because of how restrictive and bland the projects and assignments made by teachers are.
2054,9d0c6f1e0db4,If our society depends on the creativity and skill set of the current generation in schools why not give them the opportunity to develop their skills and be able to flourish in their own success?
2055,c0f0a52668fc,Which is why I think that summer projects should be student designed
2056,597ae99f06ab,its helps students learn to become more creative
2057,aa25fb827676,helps prepare them for the future.
2058,c9dbe84ab3ac,Students usually spend their summer either sleeping or just having fun with their friends trying to make the most out of the break but as students reach high schools they find that they have to do projects over the summer.
2059,c9dbe84ab3ac,Almost all students are annoyed at the fact that they have to do a summer project for a class and most of them leave it till the last second to actually do it
2060,a2c8a36e015d,If students were allowed to design these projects themselves it would give them the will and incentive to do it because they would have designed it in a way that it would seem interesting to them
2061,31eba7adfa33,"It would help break away from their habit of carelessly doing it and having them get creative with their project and make something astonishing,"
2062,4c9402257c99,By letting students design their own projects to do over the summer it also helps them develop real life skills that they can use in the workplace.
2063,4c9402257c99,Students dont tend to learn anything new over the summer since they are focused on their break and enjoying it as much as possible but doing a project that takes time and interests them helps them learn what goes into making a project and what the requirements are.
2064,4c9402257c99,This helps students to use their new found abilities in the workplace to much more easily express their creativity since they now know the tools to show it.
2065,5396bebe9f9e,"When teachers make summer projects for students it makes it harder for a student to care about the project because they didnt really have a part in making it, so if the teachers decide on making a project based on a topic a student doesnt like they wouldnt be as interested."
2066,5396bebe9f9e,"It would lead to them wanting to do the bear minimum and be done with it, never even inspiring them use their creativity"
2067,f5b7e1f07748,Which is why when a student makes their own project they can be more creative and choose a topic or idea that interests them related to the class doing their best effort to portray how much they care about it.
2068,c77b2d12b588,It could be argued that if students made their own projects they would make it easy that it wouldnt take any time for them to finish it.
2069,588865be4508,Although some students would just want to be done with their project and do something easy most students would want to use this project as an opportunity to get their point and ideas across
2070,93804ac28038,"When a person cares about something they want it to be the best , so when a student designs a project in which they care about they would obviously want to do their best since they put so much work into it."
2071,93804ac28038,So saying that a student wouldnt care about a project they created would be wrong since even if they did design a bad project they would be the one doing it and would make it much harder for themselves.
2072,194bceb88ae0,There is so much good that can come out of letting students design their own projects not only for them but for their future as well.
2073,194bceb88ae0,If teachers give students the opportunity to design their own project then they would be teaching more than the class but skills they can use in the future as well.
2074,194bceb88ae0,Since creativity is the backbone of everything in the world when teachers start to make new ideas to have students think more creatively it helps the development of new ideas and innovations in the future.
2075,4380c6e83b2c,Making extracurricular activities mandatory for students is not a valid rule that should be enforced.
2076,b8834b6f0cdb,"I don't agree that all students should have to participate in one extracurricular activity,"
2077,413e6ad4af72,whether students graduate or not shouldn't be determined by an extracurricular activity that they may or may not have done
2078,ff5414d24375,most of the students already do an out of school activity
2079,e4afd2e6d3d6,students shouldn't be forced to do something that they dont want to do.
2080,d66c12cc3407,"Just because they didn't take part in the chess club, or the yearbook committee doesn't mean that they should be held back."
2081,d66c12cc3407,"Someone could be the next Albert Einstein and focus on school so much that he didn't have time for extracurricular activities, but you decide to hold him back because of a silly little thing he didn't do."
2082,d66c12cc3407,Whether students do extracurricular activities or not shouldn't determine if they proceed to learn new things.
2083,d66c12cc3407,The administrators should look at their grades and their work habits.
2084,d66c12cc3407,"It does not make a valid reason for them to be robbed of their opportunity to be smarter, if they just didn't participate in an extracurricular activity."
2085,3a494d2112f3,What if you dont have time?
2086,3a494d2112f3,"Most students already do an after school activity like sports, or a youth group."
2087,3a494d2112f3,Some students even do multiple sports and still balance that with school.
2088,3a494d2112f3,"So for them to try and balance their after school activities, school, and now an extracurricular activity, it would be chaos."
2089,3a494d2112f3,"Students already go through enough stress with peer pressure, and their grades, and maybe just problems at home, so they shouldn't have to worry about this too."
2090,3a494d2112f3,"For example, maybe some students want to get a scholarship through playing a sport,and maybe their really good and actually have a chance at getting one."
2091,3a494d2112f3,If you enforce that rule they would have to focus less on their sport and more on the extracurricular activity.
2092,204a0d7b914b,Some students have trouble socializing with others.
2093,204a0d7b914b,So maybe they didn't apply for an activity because they just didn't want too.
2094,204a0d7b914b,"Some students also enjoy their free time, time where they can do homework, be on their electronic devices, or just take a nap."
2095,204a0d7b914b,So they didn't want to do an extracurricular activity because they didn't want to give up their free time.
2096,204a0d7b914b,Students shouldn't have to feel like they are forced to do something.
2097,204a0d7b914b,"I mean it is called extracurricular activity for a reason, because it's for extra credit, so it shouldn't be a mandatory thing that they have to do."
2098,8cab1a20ad9d,"Students graduating shouldn't be decided by if they did an extracurricular activity or not,and the students who already do after school activities don't have time for for extracurricular things,and students should not have to be pressured to do something if its not mandatory, so I don't agree that students should have to take part in an extracurricular activity."
2099,6ef3a1e5a09d,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author describes the new technology facial Action Coding System or FACS which allows a computer to pick up on what you feel like and how you are feeling."
2100,a44f41216a31,I claim that the use of FACS in a class room enviroment could have used but mostly believe it is not a valuable resource in class.
2101,5fa30a138939,"One reason why It is not a vaulable resource is it only programed to read six basic human emotions which are Happieness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness."
2102,fb8e9da3f739,"The human body has way more than just six emotions so getting a high accuracy reading on how you are really feeling is out of the question because FACS uses the a process of a 3-D model Dr. Huang states ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."""
2103,fb8e9da3f739,This quote explains that it has to use a way of making a model which can sometimes take some time depending on the processing power of the computer not only that but human emotions can change quite quickly and if the pc doesnt make the model fast enough the computer can easly fail at getting and accuarate reading.
2104,39af54cab7b4,Another reason why it is invaulable is that a human is already prepared to read another persons emotions because it is a task that is already done each and everyday.
2105,7f5cec37d285,Dr. Huang is talking about the device using video images to pick up the emotions of each person.
2106,7f5cec37d285,"Dr. H states ""using video imagery, The new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movments in a real face or on a painted face."""
2107,7f5cec37d285,This quote brings to light that the machine can read emotions but one could say since it is still in new development that not all of the bugs or glitches have been worked out not only that but you also have to devote more resources to keep the machine working which can average to be a heafty hit to your wallet.
2108,5f74738d0f37,Another person could say it is vaulable to help students and keep them entertained in a lesson and switch it up a bit.
2109,24f1d6c6749b,Dr. Huang is talking about how it can change the ads you see and veiw if you dont look happy when you look at them.
2110,24f1d6c6749b,"Dr. Huang states ""For example when a web ad appears on your screen and you smile a similar ad may follow, But if you frown the next ad will be different."
2111,24f1d6c6749b,"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts."
2112,24f1d6c6749b,This Quote and prediction of Dr. Huang states that is has potential to keep students intrestred into work
2113,b08a4ee1c7b7,but the problem being is that a program so complex like that requires so much code and algorithms that it requires a beffy computer to run so you would need to make multiple servers capable of holding that much information not only that but the school would have to divert much more of their budget toward stronger computers
2114,bfd38f036812,"Dr. Huang states Your home Pc cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode smiles"" This saying from Dr. Huang proves that a PC for home use is not strong enough for this program so what makes you average home pc different from a school one other than filters put on the pc which reduces preformance but the worse thing that could happen is what if the power happens to shut down or go out do to a surge that program requires power to run so that is also a big problem."
2115,5e1886aebf2c,"In conclusion, The use of FACS in a classroom enviroment sounds like a great idea but when you put it in different catagories it fails in almost every one of them you dont need a computer to read emotions when a human is perfectly capable of know how you feel even if it is just a little bit."
2116,5e1886aebf2c,The schools will need more funding diverted to even run the program and keep it working when schools already have a budget that they have to work on and they will need to be prepared to do something if the power goes out because that system will not run if it has incffecient power.
2117,80077636b6b4,The curiousity about Mars has been going on for centuries.
2118,80077636b6b4,"People say that there is or once was life on Mars, and now they are saying that there is a face on Mars."
2119,80077636b6b4,"Humans all around the world have questioned whether the ""Face"" was created by aliens or just a natural landform."
2120,8e97dcbf20db,it's just a natural landform.
2121,353a9a214242,"In 1976, Viking 1 took photos of Mars and found a huge rock formation that remebled a human head with shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth."
2122,353a9a214242,"This was soon to be known as the ""Face on Mars""."
2123,6e79b9daa923,People made a huge deal out of it.
2124,6e79b9daa923,"The ""Face on Mars"" appeared in books, magazines, and radio talk shows."
2125,6e79b9daa923,Some people even say it appeared in haunted grocery store checkouts.
2126,9a8677bf9911,"On April 5, 1998, NASA's MGS flew over Cydonia, the siting of the face, to snap more picture to reveal that the Face was just a natural landform and nothing more"
2127,46535e550d93,"The majority of people accepted this statement, but there was a select few people who say that aliens made the Face."
2128,cc99c4c2e587,The Face Theorists weren't satisfied with it being just a landform and tried to find evidence to prove NASA wrong.
2129,cc99c4c2e587,The Face Theorists found out that the location and date of the April '98 photo was during a cloudy winter.
2130,cc99c4c2e587,Skeptics said that the alien markings were hidden by the haze.
2131,19d4def5de92,"Three years later, NASA proved our skeptical theorists wrong again."
2132,7869a0b74c1d,"With advanced technology, the right location, and the right season, NASA got the clear picture of the Face they needed to show that it was just a landform."
2133,7869a0b74c1d,NASA even suggests that it may be a butte or mesa
2134,ebc56910b6ac,"Sorry Face Theorists, but NASA

has crushed your dreams multiple times."
2135,ebc56910b6ac,"The ""Face on Mars"" is just a landform."
2136,ebc56910b6ac,Nothing more and nothing less
2137,b2b0f67e96f4,I'm here to tell you that the face on mars is not the face to a martian
2138,ccbdac4fee89,but there is always both sides to a situation like this.
2139,f1fdf1681fb3,I'm a scientist and there are some explanation to why this face exsict on both sides
2140,3fb0490168c7,"My side is that the face on mars could be seen wrong, it could be a pile of rocks,"
2141,2206242aed43,"and there is many wierd things on this planet with weird shapes, it cant always be martians or aliens."
2142,dcd2c8a75c93,So to start this off it could be a alien but there is a strong possibility that its not either.
2143,8f291e76f152,"First the face is way to larg to be an actual face, it say it the artical the it is measured in meters, thats almost impossible"
2144,1570964208db,It also says in the artical that the face on mars was just an illusion caused by the shadowing on the rocks to make it look like a face.
2145,1570964208db,If you look furter into the artical it says that everytime they went across the planet that it looked exactly the same.
2146,e3ce3e509cf7,It is a real debate on whether the face is real or not.
2147,e3ce3e509cf7,"There is also strong evidence on both sides, but NASA has alot of proof that it isn't an alien, they could be hiding it or they can be wrong."
2148,dbf1373431e4,Limiting car usage is a discrase
2149,9df6f0ce63ab,"Why stop making cars when thats what we need the most in this world, with out a car we cant go no where."
2150,9df6f0ce63ab,What they should do is cut down the price to a lower price cause not everyone in this world is a multi millioner.
2151,9df6f0ce63ab,"For example on paragraph 12 it says almost 4,000 drivers were fine,according to Reuters ... Twenty seven people had their cars imounded for their reactions to the fine, thats just crazy how they take cars away from people just because of their actions against the fine."
2152,9df6f0ce63ab,Thats easier to imagine than a car-free Champs Elysees.
2153,9df6f0ce63ab,"Congestion was down 60% in the capital of France, after five-days of intensifying smog."
2154,9df6f0ce63ab,"Diesel fuel was blamed, sinced Franced has."
2155,9df6f0ce63ab,. . a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline.

2199,eb736bf65b72,Extracurricular activities have been a controversial topic of discussion for decades.
2200,eb736bf65b72,"Parents, teachers, students, and principals have felt the need to express their opinion on the implementation of extracurricular activities."
2201,eb736bf65b72,"I attend Generic_School, a place where students have many extracurricular activities to choose from, all of which take place after the school day is over."
2202,eb736bf65b72,Some choose to attend and others choose to abstain.
2203,eb736bf65b72,"I partake in them occasionally, but I tend to go home once the final bell rings."
2204,eb736bf65b72,"That was before my principal decided that all

Generic_School students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity, whether it be sports, yearbook design, student council, or something else."
2205,eb736bf65b72,"This decree has denied the freedom of choice to not only me, but hundreds of other students at my school with regards to extracurricular activities."
2206,ed4b452fd3f6,I strongly disagree with the decision of my principal on this matter
2207,81606fd54cbd,because forcing students to participate in extracurricular activities exhausts students
2208,b74810d0d4ce,tremendously decreases the time that a student has to complete schoolwork assigned to them.
2209,e6829bffa24f,"rather than giving students time to relax, it depletes their energy."
2210,e6829bffa24f,Generic_School students are tired as it is.
2211,d7bc0b52c54b,"To understand how fatigued they are, allow me to use an example of someone who is exhausted without the addition of extracurricular activities to their schedule: me."
2212,d7bc0b52c54b,"I wake up at 5:50, board my school bus at 6:30, attend school from 7:30 to 2:15, get home at 3:00, and do homework for four hours before eating dinner and going to sleep."
2213,d7bc0b52c54b,"Add three hours to the mix and I am going to bed at 11:00, giving me only six hours to sleep."
2214,d7bc0b52c54b,"Not seven, not eight, not nine, and certainly not ten."
2215,d7bc0b52c54b,"Following a routine where there is only time for six hours of sleep decreases concentration, slows thinking, damages memory, and can even stunt growth during puberty."
2216,d7bc0b52c54b,Generic_School students cannot simply adapt to the new conditions.
2217,d7bc0b52c54b,No middle school student can.
2218,d7bc0b52c54b,That is why Generic_School students should not have to chronically attend extracurricular activities because it hurts students more than it helps them.
2219,3f9e11e791fc,"rather than giving students a sacred time and place to complete schoolwork, it massively decreases work and study time."
2220,8a560997676a,"At Generic_School Middle School, there is a particular extracurricular activity called ""Generic_Name's Work Zone"" or ""WWZ."""
2221,8a560997676a,WWZ is a place where students are able to sit down and complete schoolwork.
2222,8a560997676a,"Those that attend for the sole purpose of doing work choose to do so at Generic_Name's Work Zone rather than at home because WWZ is a silent work area, which should aid concentration."
2223,8a560997676a,The problem is that most Generic_School students who attend do not come there to do work or to study but to instead play games which can distract those who are trying to work.
2224,8a560997676a,"Trust me, I know from experience."
2225,8a560997676a,I could not do more than 30 minutes of work before being sucked into my cell phone.
2226,8a560997676a,"WWZ lasts for an hour, only half of which I used for work."
2227,8a560997676a,That is why I stopped going.
2228,8a560997676a,"However, I do not have that option anymore now that I must participate in at least one extracurricular activity and somehow make time to work without being distracted, however difficult it may be."
2229,8a560997676a,That is why Generic_School students should not have to routinely attend extracurricular activities because it takes work and study time away from them.
2230,81d4b6187e83,I strongly disagree with the decision of my principal because forcing Generic_School students to participate in extracurricular activities wears them out and decreases the time that a Generic_School student has to finish assigned work.
2231,81d4b6187e83,"First of all, extracurricular activities melt a student's energy and can negatively impact a student's health and well-being."
2232,81d4b6187e83,"Second, extracurricular activities lead to students being distracted, ultimately depleting work and study time."
2233,81d4b6187e83,"Extracurricular activities were supposed to be a way to help students complete work, come to school happier, and get better grades."
2234,81d4b6187e83,"However, force-feeding extracurricular activities to Generic_School students will not produce the desired effect that my principal hopes it will, and that is a fact."
2235,ac65257c7619,Giving students summer projects keeps their brains functioning.
2236,ac65257c7619,Some schools require that students complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.
2237,17b369240fec,summer projects should be teacher-designed
2238,5d9e885eec9f,"they know the content,"
2239,054842f0028e,have more resources
2240,239c5af80c77,have more experience.
2241,de9c621d0fa4,All teachers know what content they will be teaching giving them an edge to designing summer projects for students.
2242,08c2cc7bde33,With an understanding of the content they will able to create projects that will be beneficial to the the students.
2243,08c2cc7bde33,"Moreover, the teacher can plan summer projects that include information that the students will learn throughout the school giving the students a head start."
2244,08c2cc7bde33,"For example, a math teacher might give his or her student a math related summer project which will cover topics that will be learn't in the upcoming school year."
2245,08c2cc7bde33,This makes the project something that will be helpful for the students and keeps their minds working.
2246,08c2cc7bde33,It will also make their school year easier since they've already learned some topics through the summer project.
2247,63024494f8c1,Teachers also have more resources to be able to produce summer projects for students to keep them engaged.
2248,906902980803,Many teachers attend workshops and meetings to learn about ways to make their lessons better.
2249,906902980803,This gives them immense amounts of resources they could use to put together helpful summer projects.
2250,906902980803,They also have connections to other teachers and programs that students don't have the access to.
2251,906902980803,These connections are important since they provide useful information.
2252,906902980803,"With that said, teachers would produce better summer projects than students would."
2253,80e1cdaca33d,"Finally, teachers have more experience when it comes to designing projects"
2254,a24dc8573ec1,A big part of a teachers jobs is to create projects and worksheets for their students all year long.
2255,a24dc8573ec1,This gives them experience regrading what the students will enjoy and how to plan the projects.
2256,a24dc8573ec1,They would also know how to assure that the students are learning but in a fun way based off their experience.
2257,a24dc8573ec1,"Teachers go through college to learn all this, so they have a lot of experience and a good understanding of what projects should entail."
2258,0e597bae495c,"However, some might say students should be able to design the summer projects because they are the ones that have to do it"
2259,448430d4347a,It is true that students are the ones that have to complete the projects but the teachers know what will be better for the students to help benefit them
2260,c2e69b87653d,"For example, a student might create a project where they have to play video games."
2261,c2e69b87653d,This would not benefit the students in anyway since they will not be learning anything
2262,fab43f32a246,"Therefore, summer projects should be designed by teachers because they know the content, have more resources and have more experience to assure that students continue learning during their break."
2263,8d99807b6030,"Joining the Seagoing Cowboys program is a great place to help with horses, young cows, and mules"
2264,bc93dbf24e7c,"You can travel the world and see places like China, Europe, Greece, and Italy."

2271,2773b6912ce5,"You could help the countries recover their food supply, animals, and more."
2272,2773b6912ce5,It could be fun caring for an animal like it was your own pet.
2273,b724fb904917,being a Seagoing Cowboy would be a fun job to do
2274,d9063041082f,It will help you experience a once in a lifetime thing.

2293,eafe9f519d39,NACA try to challenge them self they been trying to find a way to land on venus and makes sure that the spaceship can land on venus.
2294,eafe9f519d39,NASA are still working on a spaceship to land more than a few hours so they can see more things about venus that we don't know about.

2339,606f058cfb22,"Summer break is the most anticipated time of year for students and teachers because it is a grace period that allows for relaxation and refreshment,of one's soul."
2340,606f058cfb22,"The summer sees,the mental maturation of many students without the hindrance of a classroom,holding them back."
2341,606f058cfb22,The learning experience offered in a classroom setting is limited only to what the teacher and state permits.
2342,606f058cfb22,Students are not fully able to express their learning passions because they are forced to learn what the teacher permits.
2343,606f058cfb22,"Whereas, during the summer students are free to conduct their own personal investigations on topics that peak their interest, resulting in a much maturer student by the time fall rolls around."
2344,831e339d744d,"To coincide with the theme of change and growth summer promotes, students should have the ability to choose their own projects, to further their educational experience and mental development, without the influence of a teacher."
2345,6f15eab533b6,"The ability for students to choose their own summer projects would enhance their outlook on education,because they would study topics that interest them,and not teacher selected topics that would seem like a task."
2346,f802921ec350,It is a scientifically proven fact that students retain knowledge that speaks to their own curiosities and that holds the most relevance to them.
2347,f802921ec350,"During the summer, many students travel to new places or try new things."
2348,f802921ec350,"For example, last summer I was blessed with the opportunity to travel to Japan with my friends and family."
2349,f802921ec350,"While I was there I tried new cuisines,participated in festivities and I was able to learn about their history."
2350,f802921ec350,"My time in Japan, sparked an interest that I never knew I had in Japanese Geisha."
2351,f802921ec350,I spent hours upon hours researching everything I could on them.
2352,f802921ec350,"But, my research was limited because I had to complete an AP Human Geography summer assignment administered by my future teacher."
2353,f802921ec350,My assignment was to write a paper and create a brochure about a country.
2354,f802921ec350,I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to write all about my trip to Japan.
2355,f802921ec350,That is until I realized the teacher had already selected countries based on our last names.
2356,f802921ec350,"I was stuck with Great Britain, a country I already had a lot of knowledge of from history class and videos."
2357,f802921ec350,I like many students completed the assignment without gaining any new information because doing the project felt as if it were a chore.
2358,f802921ec350,"Though,I do still remember the information I learned from conducting my own research into Geisha."
2359,1ec02be17a31,Many teachers would argue that a student designed summer project would lack information or seem to rushed.
2360,8cc8f4493dcd,Which would not be the case at all.
2361,8cc8f4493dcd,"Many students would take their time in crafting a project that meets all standards and would probably write more than what is expected, due to the project peaking their interest."
2362,8cc8f4493dcd,"Teachers would in fact, see an increase of higher marks."
2363,8cc8f4493dcd,"However, if a teacher feels that the project is not up to standards they could always low score it and have the student try again."
2364,8cc8f4493dcd,In allowing students to design their own project teachers will receive projects that exceed all requirements due to the students behind the projects being interested in what they were learning.
2365,50f063c9d64e,"If students were able to create their own summer projects, the result would be a more creative,responsible and independent thinking person"
2366,49eacc878070,"Teacher designed projects allow no room for creativity nor responsibility because there are guidelines and an examples set in place by the teacher,students have to follow."
2367,49eacc878070,"Thus, resulting in one hundred or more projects that all sound the same and lack any indication of the student's voice."
2368,337cc08baa57,"Teachers would argue that summer projects must be designed by them, so that all students are able to receive full credit."
2369,18ede080d744,"Which is great in theory,but not in the long run."
2370,18ede080d744,"It does not benefit the student to have a guideline or rubric, it only benefits the teacher because the projects would be easier to grade."
2371,e3d93e205dbf,"In the future, once students start working, supervisors will not give them examples of how to properly execute a project."
2372,e3d93e205dbf,"For example, my mother is a graphic designer who is required to come with new ideas for campaigns, brochures and websites."
2373,e3d93e205dbf,"Her boss isn't giving her instructions on how to complete the tasks, at all."
2374,e3d93e205dbf,She must be responsible in using her mind to come up with creative new ideas that she thinks would satisfy her boss.
2375,e3d93e205dbf,"However, at her old job all the graphic designers were given an example they had to follow."
2376,e3d93e205dbf,Which resulted in the closing of her old company because they only produced the same design.
2377,e3d93e205dbf,"Luckily for mom, she was able to find another job fast because she was to create designs without assistance."
2378,e3d93e205dbf,"The skills my mother used to think creatively and on her own, was taught in school."
2379,e3d93e205dbf,"But, with teachers designing projects, students get used to a formula they have to follow and are not taking responsibility for their own thinking."
2380,e3d93e205dbf,Students creating their own summer projects would force students to take time and think of a project that they think would satisfy their teacher.
2381,e3d93e205dbf,"It would stimulate new thoughts and force them to activate the create side of their brain that has not been used for a while,due to teachers constantly creating a rubric and examples for the student."
2382,e3d93e205dbf,The summer is a perfect opportunity for a student designed project because they would have time to develop their thoughts.
2383,e3d93e205dbf,Teachers shouldn't design summer projects because it aides in diminishing a student's ability to creatively solve projects.
2384,b87b6c2bfdd9,Students should have the ability to create their own summer assignments because it would promote mental and educational growth that would otherwise be hindered in a classroom setting.
2385,b87b6c2bfdd9,Summer break allows students to embark on new experiences that can further expand their knowledge on topics that interest them.
2386,b87b6c2bfdd9,It would also allow more time for students to develop their ideas for the project.
2387,b87b6c2bfdd9,Which would strengthen their creativity and responsibility skills.
2388,b87b6c2bfdd9,Student designed projects would help grow character.
2389,76c46d88a9a1,People have studied the many planets in our solar system and are fastinated by them.
2390,76c46d88a9a1,People have also studied the solar system to help explore and give information about the planets around us.
2391,76c46d88a9a1,"One planet that scientists have studied for a good amount of time is Venus since it shows that at one time, the planet might have inhabited living organisms."
2392,76c46d88a9a1,"However, Venus is a very dangerous planet since many attempts of landing spacecraft has failed on Venus and the clouds of the planet are made of sulfuric acid."
2393,76c46d88a9a1,Venus is not worth the pursuit of knowledge since the planet has a very dangerous enviorment for humans and that not a single spacecraft has landed safely on the planet and returned.
2394,e1f8c8709b9a,The cost and risk of exploring Venus is not worth the infromation we would achieve.
2395,164ff3213938,Venus has a enviorment of very dangerous elements that can harm many living organisms and even nonliving objects
2396,971f8625a092,"According to the article, 97 percent of the atmosphere of Venus is carbon dioxide, which is unable to be breathed by humans."
2397,971f8625a092,"Another detail the article states is that on the surface of the planet, the average temperatures is over eight hundred degrees."
2398,971f8625a092,The climate and enviorment of Venus is too dangerous for exploration.
2399,971f8625a092,The planet does not hold nowhere near a safe enviorment for people or even machine.
2400,616053f8cd46,Another detail about Venus is that no spacecfaft has made a journey back from the planet.
2401,b1c71eb3612f,"The article says, ¨... humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud-draped world,¨ and then says ¨... since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.¨ If a spacecraft made by people can not survive the landing on Venus numerous times, how can we even come close to surviving the trip?"
2402,b1c71eb3612f,Venus is too dangerous to explore and it is a waste to even send a spacecraft.
2403,b1c71eb3612f,The spacecrafts cost a good amount of money to make and for them to be wasted on a inhospitable planet is not worth the information we would achieve.
2404,1990bb58e2cd,NASA has came up with a ¨solution¨ of the problemof gaining knowledge of Venus which is for a vehicle to hover over Venus and scientists would safely observe the planet that way.
2405,6e40e43574aa,"However, the article says that this can only give us a limited amount of information on Venus since the planet has a very dense atmosphere."
2406,6e40e43574aa,The effort of creating a vehicle to hover the planet only to gain bits of knowledge is redundant and is not going the benefit anyone´s cause.
2407,4c2688e77d3c,"Venus is not worth the time, effort and resources to explore."
2408,4c2688e77d3c,The planet proves to be too dangerous for mankind and even for machines.
2409,4c2688e77d3c,Curiosity is not sufficiant enough of a reason to explore and learn about a inhospitable planet unless it is going to benefit mankind more than what it costed to gain that information.
2410,4c2688e77d3c,The resources that are going to Venus should be redirected to another cause that will benefit society and life as we know it.
2411,9402bfbb33c5,"The new technology it was created by, what does it do,is it a good thing."
2412,a97f2a273519,The software is the latest innovation fro professer.
2413,a97f2a273519,"Thomas Huang,of the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science at the Universiy of illinos,working in collaboation with Professer Nicu."
2414,a97f2a273519,Sebe of the University.
2415,a97f2a273519,Dr. Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better way for human and coumputers to communicate.
2416,a97f2a273519,The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face;all 44 major muscles in the the model must move like humans muscels.
2417,a97f2a273519,"Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."""
2418,a97f2a273519,"Then Dr. Huang relies on the work of pyschologists such as Dr. Paul Eckman,creator of FACS."
2419,a97f2a273519,They want to use this technology to help in a classroom to see when a kid is confused or boerd to help them to plan lesson that the kids will learn from.
2420,a97f2a273519,"Eckman has claaified six basic emotions happiness,surprise,anger,disgust,fear,and sadness and then associated each with characteristic movements of facial muscles"
2421,ffe547bdb117,I think we should use the new technology in classroom
2422,9677673a7d6b,because I think I will become dectration to kids because they will want to play with it to see her they feel.
2423,9677673a7d6b,This type of technology should be use for treapist to help read patient when they are talk about their life so the treapist know how they felt about that part in there life.
2424,eaa22311a1c8,The use of this technology for a classroom full of students will not be valuable.
2425,c457abecf57a,Although it would be interesting to see what the students are feeling during a lesson.
2426,1332e6d4c1f6,How is the data going to be of use in science?
2427,513f6aae930f,"The students can express their feelings, but what are the researchers going to do with this information."
2428,0bb14f86c48f,"This technology should be used, but not in the classroom."
2429,4067d320b517,If we do end up using the system to detect emotions where will the data go.
2430,cd1b16de087a,"It will help the video game industry with the evidence from paragraph 6 ""The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressive-for video games or video surgery."""
2431,e8a98db1f94a,"Why only put this into a classroom put it into the robots we are building today so they seem more human-like, so they can become more advanced than a ordinary robot"
2432,ffaddf7031e6,"The direction the researchers are taking are great, but the choice of where to put it needs to be different."
2433,ffaddf7031e6,Just putting it into a classroom would be a waste of time and money.
2434,2ac3e8699f52,There is so much wasted potential if the system is put into a classroom.
2435,2ac3e8699f52,we could use this technology for bigger and better things.
2436,2ac3e8699f52,For instance better facial recognition security systems so it can be more accurate reading faces and does not open or let in anyone that looks like the person.
2437,2ac3e8699f52,Or lock the person out of anything that is protected by facial recognition.
2438,2ac3e8699f52,Another example of how this could be useful in other ways is the facial recognition can be used in the police force to find a match of a person that was caught on camera to be tracked down and captured.
2439,558b770fdef0,The way that the researchers are using it for is inefficient and wasteful and should not be implemented in classrooms.
2440,6786dd98fba8,so you want to take all the cars out of the city ok cool
2441,c0890f509c10,"this will save the pepol like 1,000,000 dolers a year"
2442,ebe90365ac0f,reduce polution
2443,f6152201fc70,i gess its a good idea but on the other hand nah i mean lookif pepal want to ruin the world with gas thats there choce man
2444,1600954b28a9,the eirth is cool so why distroit with gasis or something
2445,b4bdc46dc8f7,""" your principle has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity""."
2446,b4bdc46dc8f7,"How would you feel if your principle has made this decision?, and would you agree with this or disagree?."
2447,8dca3c5fdb69,"I feel as though, the principle has made the right desicion."
2448,f55b63e69844,"I agree with this desicion because, this desicion could do everyone some good."
2449,f53f5d47a087,Doing some type of sport or even working on the school news paper could be fun.
2450,f53f5d47a087,It would be expecially good for parents.
2451,f53f5d47a087,Why?
2452,f53f5d47a087,"you might ask because, the students won't come home as early, and the parents will have time to run erin's and get some stuff done before their children get home."
2453,f53f5d47a087,The parents will also be able to just have more time to their selves.
2454,07c674ccaa14,this could be helpful to the children mentally and physically.
2455,7492b3cc1ebe,Three out of four children and teens spend more than seven hours on their phone or watching television.
2456,7492b3cc1ebe,"These devises put out blue light into the the eye which is bad because, this can cause straining in the eye or even total blindness."
2457,7492b3cc1ebe,when you are on your phone most of the time you have acess to the internet which means you can get on social media websites.
2458,7492b3cc1ebe,"When on websites like snapchat and instagram teens tend to compare their selves to others, and if they aren't up to par to look like ""pretty"" people they can get sad and form some type of depression."
2459,ea37a4a4462f,"Overall, students should build more life skills and social skills, and adding extracurricular activity's to the students day can help with that."
2460,5b4b4d1c8933,"building life skills at a younger age can be great so, when you get out into the world you'll atleast know some key factors to living."
2461,5b4b4d1c8933,Building social skills is great too.
2462,5b4b4d1c8933,"Lets say you get a job in marketing, you need to be social, have great speech, and be outgoing."
2463,5b4b4d1c8933,"In fact, you need social skills for any job."
2464,5b4b4d1c8933,The principle making the desicion to add an extracurricular activity's to students day at school was and great idea.
2465,3a648f0260ca,"adding an extracurricular activity to all of the student body would be an great idea because, it could be benifial to students, parents."

2467,3a648f0260ca,Building social skills.
2468,3a648f0260ca,"Life skills, and just being productive has all to do with adding an extracurricular activity to a students day."
2469,9499c209950f,In the article they are talking about a new technology called Facial Action Coding System where the computer can identify human emotions.
2470,d4ab33e57373,I think that this new technology can be very valuable for teachers in schools to know when a student is sad or upset.
2471,782d7afb4e59,The computer can help a teacher/adult to understand when a student is in need of a talk or needs to express their emotions
2472,0fc3b66d2551,This is also very valuable because it could potentially save a life in bad situations.
2473,1e1a424fad88,"This system can alert a teacher or anyone when there might be something wrong with a person, whether it is good or bad."
2474,c4a1a2aff13a,To be able to understand how a person feels may be one of the best new technologies created.
2475,c4a1a2aff13a,"Knowing when a person is feeling sad, angry, happy, etc, can really be great for if they need someone to talk to."
2476,c4a1a2aff13a,It could make things better or make things not so good.
2477,c4a1a2aff13a,Just having those options of emotions to be recognized is something very amazing.
2478,c4a1a2aff13a,"Even though this system can't contol your emotions or thoughts, it can really help to understand when there is something good or bad going on."
2479,41d6e6891642,I think another use for this could be in hospitals to detect if a patient is lying about their emotions.
2480,d04859ab84fe,"Even though a patient in a hospital may not like this because it can see their true emotions, it might be able to help them in the long run."
2481,d04859ab84fe,"If this technology can help manage what another person is feeling then it can make them see whats really going on, even if they lie about it."
2482,d79a01e2bc6f,The computer will construct a 3-D model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.
2483,d79a01e2bc6f,"Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit."""
2484,d79a01e2bc6f,"Dr. Paul Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."
2485,d79a01e2bc6f,All of humans show the same facial expressions but maybe some at different times.
2486,d79a01e2bc6f,"The Mona Lisa demonstration is intened to bring a smile to our face, while it shows just how much this computer can do."
2487,c78a2b1626f0,Is getting emotional facial recognization the best way to go with technology?
2488,c78a2b1626f0,Computers are getting smarter and it doesn't sound like it will be slowing down any time soon.
2489,c78a2b1626f0,When scientests and computer programers combine it can be a beautiful thing.
2490,c78a2b1626f0,Scientests are developing better ways for humans and computers to comunicate.
2491,c78a2b1626f0,With new encoding and development of software scientests have now created a way for a computer to tell how someone is feeling by using their facial muscles.
2492,b6407becbad9,"The new programing will be a positive thing,"
2493,699664579e6a,muscles in the face just act naturally
2494,f1458202ed07,the encoding is complex
2495,aa46b103aa9b,the new technology could be coming to local classrooms.
2496,1bcb2ac0e7b3,The Scientests have a whole process.
2497,64c446e3fadd,The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D model of the face and has all 44 major muscles that must move like human muscles (D'Alto 3).
2498,64c446e3fadd,"All of the muscle units that work together as one is called an ""action unit."""
2499,64c446e3fadd,Since all facial emotions are universal the technology could go worldwide once improved.
2500,64c446e3fadd,The software could also identify mixed emotions.
2501,64c446e3fadd,The technology reads how major muscles move and show emotion.
2502,64c446e3fadd,With each emotion that is showed they compare it to a neutral face.
2503,64c446e3fadd,Every day humans do the same thing.
2504,64c446e3fadd,Humans read the face of other humans to try and tell how they are feeling.
2505,64c446e3fadd,If they are sad or happy.
2506,64c446e3fadd,"There are six major emotions within the technology right now, there maybe more encoded at a later date."
2507,c94575f6fe00,With the new technology comes new computers.
2508,aba2bde7e19d,A home PC could not take the proper encoding right now.
2509,aba2bde7e19d,The scientests are working on something much better to try and get the home PC's to where they can encode them.
2510,aba2bde7e19d,The scientests new computer software stores similar anatomical information as an electric code (D'Alto 5).
2511,aba2bde7e19d,"Although the home PC couldn't handle the encoding, they can give simple encoding to your home PC."
2512,aba2bde7e19d,The encdoing that can be given is simple instructions for differnent emotions.
2513,aba2bde7e19d,The simple encoding would not be able to read mixed emotions.
2514,9af8a9ea55eb,The emotional facial reading could be coming to a local schools.
2515,b8c6a847effb,"The new technology would be able to tell if a student was bored, or if they got confused."
2516,b8c6a847effb,Then the computer could modify the lesson for the student to help them learn better.
2517,b8c6a847effb,The technology could act like an effective human instructor.
2518,b8c6a847effb,Must human communication is nonverbal.
2519,b8c6a847effb,Emotional communication is also nonverbal.
2520,b8c6a847effb,The studesnts could improve with one on one lesson plans.
2521,b8c6a847effb,The studensts could also work at their own pace and have their own personal plans.
2522,b536e411d765,All the technology needs to understand how to read and comunicate with a human through facial features.
2523,b536e411d765,The anatomy of a human is complex and hard to understand and encode into computers.
2524,b536e411d765,"The new programing will be a positive thing, muscles in the face just act naturally, the encoding is complex, and the new technology could be coming to local classrooms."
2525,b536e411d765,Scientests are hard at work trying to make the new technology common and natural for everyone to use.
2526,cf8f52b2f8b1,I stand with the principle on his decision
2527,f1e7ef456dea,I believe that participating in extracurricular activities has many benefits on a child's social life
2528,742a92a5a7b4,"Making friends while on a team or a club will be much easier, the students will have connections with others, and everyone will have something to talk about."
2529,742a92a5a7b4,"Some students may find it hard to make friends, but by being in an extracurricular activity, there are many chances to find a long lasting pal."
2530,f86203ec9262,"You may think, ""It's nice that the students can find a friend, but what if there is nothing they would like or want to participate in?"""
2531,332f522ccf23,"Well, i'm sure there is something they would enjoy, because there are many options"
2532,12fd9e6963cb,"If a student is athletic, and likes to play sports, they can join one of the many sports teams."
2533,12fd9e6963cb,"If a student likes to write, they can join the creative writing club."
2534,12fd9e6963cb,"If they like to debate on topics, they can join the debate team."
2535,12fd9e6963cb,The possibilities are endless!
2536,12fd9e6963cb,"Although there are many non academic options, there are many academic ones as well."
2537,12fd9e6963cb,"Kids who may need help with a subject can come to tutoring sessions held by other wonderful students, who want to lend a helping hand."
2538,12fd9e6963cb,"If a child has trouble focusing on their homework, there is homework club, a quiet place to work on schoolwork, where a teacher is always there to help, if need be."
2539,12fd9e6963cb,"As you can see, there are many helpful options for students who want to work on homework or other school assignments."
2540,befc2803cbd4,Extracurricular activities can also help shape students into better citizens.
2541,348f6e725764,"There are many clubs that help students learn about acceptance, kindness, and taking care of our Earth and environment."
2542,348f6e725764,Partnership club is where students work with special needs children.
2543,348f6e725764,These students learn how to accept and help care for others who are a little bit different.
2544,348f6e725764,"Diversity club is where students who are all shapes, sizes, colors, and sexualities can learn about each others backgrounds, and the everyday struggles they may deal with because of how they act or look."
2545,348f6e725764,Environmental club is where students can learn about how the environment is deteriorating and how we can help stop it from being destroyed.
2546,348f6e725764,"Also, they participate in many community service projects, from picking up trash, to measuring the PH balance in our water systems."
2547,348f6e725764,Students learn everyday what being a better citizen means.
2548,bf68771aeb02,asking students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity is a good idea.
2549,bf68771aeb02,I believe that students school and social life will change for the better.
2550,bf68771aeb02,"It may take some time to see the positive effects that this new rule will have on the school, but there will definitely be a huge, great difference within the school's community."
2551,2bd0470fbd81,Having good guidelines and being told what the expectations are will give students a better chance at success.
2552,edf3ee8c1cee,Summer projects should be teacher-designed
2553,1c51cedf7562,"because the rules and expectations act as a rubric for students to follow,"
2554,82aea3d0ef7d,as well as making sure the project is acceptable to the teachers requirements.
2555,3a99718f28f4,On social media there are examples of students who have found a loophole in the directions in order to do less work.
2556,3a99718f28f4,"For example there is this one person who had to write an essay, topic is unknown."
2557,3a99718f28f4,"There was one rule that was not clearly stated, that being the font and size, the student used that missing rule to their advantage and used a font made up of shapes, something unreadable."
2558,3a99718f28f4,"As a student I know that students tend to find a way out of work, setting expectations will give students less of a chance to get out of work."
2559,e4c33d450929,Giving student guidelines are very helpful in getting the project done.
2560,5f2266119435,In my experience not all the projects I have gotten have all the guidelines.
2561,5f2266119435,This leaves me stuck.
2562,5f2266119435,The guidelines help me determine what material I need to research and how much of it.
2563,5f2266119435,Sometimes it might even be that I dont know what kind of product I am making to convey that said research.
2564,5f2266119435,This not only provides lack of a acceptable project but also not giving good guidelines gives unwanted stress towards the student.
2565,5f2266119435,"For example some students I know worry that their project is not good enough to meet the expectations of the teacher, or that they are not doing the work that is wanted."
2566,5f2266119435,Giving guidelines will provide less stress for the student and with that a better outcome with their project.
2567,aad08f0e94af,Most classes follow a curriculum schedule that the teacher need to follow.
2568,aad08f0e94af,Without the teacher giving the project the student might not learn the things required or not learn enough for the curriculum.
2569,aad08f0e94af,When I had an online class my online teacher was very good.
2570,aad08f0e94af,She provided me with enough guidelines that I was able to learn the material needed for me to pass the class.
2571,aad08f0e94af,Having the teacher design the project will make sure that the student learns the material required for the curriculum.
2572,086e709d55da,"With a teacher-designed project the rules and expectations act as a rubric for students to follow, as well as making sure the project is acceptable to the teachers requirements."
2573,541ded402c7d,"If the project was to be designed by the students, there are too many easy ways out."
2574,5249282ce242,Students can not give themselves the material needed to pass and some students could give themselves projects that are under the expected requirements of the teacher.
2575,511962ff40a5,Having a teacher design the project gives the teacher the ability to assure the student is learning what is expected of them.
2576,88e0752c81a4,"If my principal ever decided to make students participate in an extracurricular activity, I would agree with their decision."
2577,88e0752c81a4,Joining certain extracurricular activities can bring many benefits to students' lives and open up more opportunities for them in the future.
2578,88e0752c81a4,Think about all the things you could learn through extracurricular activities.

2582,de7ca99c4f16,Joining a certain group for an extracurricular activity can help you make experiences that can open up different pathways for you in the future.
2583,8da285895dd2,"If you ever wanted to pursue a career in a certain field, extracurricular activities that you participate in now can help you prepare for what those might be."
2584,8da285895dd2,"For example, if you wanted to pursue a career in a job like graphic design, it could be helpful to join an art club or even yearbook club."
2585,8da285895dd2,"When you join clubs like these, they help you build certain strengths in areas that your preferred career specializes in."
2586,8da285895dd2,"Yearbook club, for example, allows you to design a cover for the school yearbook, which would in turn give you the experience of designing covers."
2587,8da285895dd2,A poll performed by Oxford University has showed that 76% of people who now have jobs in the art field participated in some kind of extracurricular activity at school when they were students to help them learn more about what their future jobs would be like.
2588,8da285895dd2,It can also be helpful to build experiences for things like college.
2589,8da285895dd2,"Many colleges and universities today look at not only students' grades, but also what things they participated in outside of the classroom."
2590,8da285895dd2,"The more activities that you participate in both inside and outside of school, the more qualified you are to go to certain colleges because of your strengths."
2591,8da285895dd2,It helps prepare you for different paths in the future.
2592,8da285895dd2,"Participating in extracurricular activities such as clubs and teams can not only help you build experiences for the future, but it can also help you discover what you're passionate about."
2593,0f1154d8389d,"If you decided to join in on an activity that you can participate in as an extracurricular, it might help you discover what you enjoy doing"
2594,690b7dc91200," At first when you decide to participate activities such as school clubs, you may be hesitant because you don't know if you will enjoy what you're going to do there, but your ideas might change after spending time there."
2595,690b7dc91200,"If there was a rule saying that students did have to participate in an extracurricular activity, some students might feel as though they are being forced and won't enjoy their time participating in it."
2596,690b7dc91200,"However, a lot of students' viewpoints may change over time and they grow to love the activity that they're doing."
2597,690b7dc91200,These kinds of activities can help students discover more about how they like spending their time.
2598,690b7dc91200,A poll performed on Harvard University students showed that 84% of students didn't know what they wanted to major in before joining an extracurricular activity in either middle school or high school.
2599,690b7dc91200,"A similar experiment performed by Generic_School showed that, when the principal decided all students must participate in an extracurricular activity, 92% of students enjoyed the activity that they participated in throughout the school year."
2600,690b7dc91200,It also showed that 65% of those students decided to continue that extracurricular activity the following year because they liked doing it.
2601,690b7dc91200,"Schools offer many different kinds of activities to participate in, and they can help you discover both your passions and hobbies."
2602,690b7dc91200,"When you discover what your passionate about in a certain activity, it also gives you the opportunity to socialize with peers participating in the same activity that might be interested in the same things you are."
2603,4c497187256c,"Participating in things like clubs, sports teams, or student council gives students the opportunity to meet new people and branch out."
2604,d9232f6e67db,"When you join an extracurricular activity, you're put in situations where you must work with and cooperate with others."
2605,d9232f6e67db,This type of interaction gives students the chance to meet and connect with new people.
2606,d9232f6e67db,Most activities like these use team efforts.
2607,d9232f6e67db,"For example, activities like Science Olympiad require you to collaborate with others in order to win competitions, it helps you both get along with others and develop teamwork skills."
2608,d9232f6e67db,"Overall, this can help with your future in situations where you work alongside co-workers."
2609,d9232f6e67db,You can even make close friends through extracurricular activities.
2610,d9232f6e67db,The students there most likely will share similar interests because they are all participating in an activity that focuses on a certain field that they probably enjoy.
2611,d9232f6e67db,"Sports teams, for example, give people opportunities to work with others who are very passionate about the same sport that they are."
2612,d9232f6e67db,Teammates have to cooperate with each other and work together in order to accomplish tasks.
2613,d9232f6e67db,"This is similar to most other extracurricular activities, they can help you form bonds with your peers that can last a lifetime."
2614,d9232f6e67db,This chance to socialize with others is only one of the reasons I would agree with the prinicpal's decision to make students participate in extracurriculars
2615,f8dee9cd389f,"For the reasons that I have provided as well as other ways that extracurricular activities can be beneficial, it's encouraged that more students participate in extracurricular activities."
2616,f8dee9cd389f,There are clearly many ways that it would help improve students' lives.
2617,f8dee9cd389f,"It can help them with their passions, socializing with people who share interests or views, and can help students with making new experiences to assist them in the future."
2618,f8dee9cd389f,Many schools offer a variety of different activities to join that many of the students already find to be enjoyable.
2619,f8dee9cd389f,"Because of the points made, if my principal ever decided that all students had to participate in at least one extracurricular activity, I would agree with her decision."

2652,88c9fb0a5101,"Yes I agree that Venus is dangerous place, but scientists are trying to find ways to dicover and learn more about Venus."
2653,a1936cd541a2,Many years ago scientist believed that Venus use to have Oceans and Valleys.
2654,c148292b1b70,Venus could be visted by explores but the tempature condtions is too hot for humans.
2655,c148292b1b70,Spacecraft have landed on Venus and they lasted a few hours every since then no one have been back since 3 decades.
2656,c148292b1b70,Also Venus has a very thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide.
2657,c148292b1b70,"In paragraph 3 it says ""90 times greater than what we experience of Earth"" This qoute shows that Venus is a very hot plave to live on and that humans will never be able to live there."
2658,c148292b1b70,"Venus have the hottest surface temperture of any planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our Sun"
2659,cae32a9edc44,So this shows that Venus is a very hot planet that humans can not live on because of the conditions.
2660,93e10b572c2c,"
In Conclusion scientist, spacecraft and the NASA are still trying to see what they can do about traveling to Venus but no one has not beem back since then."
2661,93e10b572c2c,This shows that Venus tempature and atmospehere is too bad to live in.
2662,c5b5cfc20531,Twenty five years ago something strange happened on mars.
2663,c5b5cfc20531,"People may have heard about ""The Face on Mars"" and thinked that it was formed by alien life."
2664,e3dc79d38739,Scientists believed the face was an alien artifact .
2665,e3dc79d38739,It actually was not.
2666,1c1989325db0,Scientists from NASA say that it was either a butte or mesa-landforms common in the american west.
2667,aa0c5b6d11d3,This subject today is still a pop icon.
2668,aa0c5b6d11d3,"It has starred in a Hollywood film , appeared in books and magazines , radio talk shows and it even haunted grocery stores checkout lines for 25 years."
2669,527e76dba6e4,"After that , everyone was not satisfied."
2670,527e76dba6e4,The face on mars is located at 41 degrees north and was winter in april 1998 - a cloudy time of year.
2671,527e76dba6e4,The camera had to peer through wispy clouds to see the face.
2672,43718f0bbb52,"People say it is not a a natural landform , they think it was from alien matter"
2673,f214e080f800,wich is not true because
2674,309d92287e2c,NASA explained in the article that it was just a Martian mesa.
2675,670f07879dd0,It was common around Cyodonia.
2676,670f07879dd0,"So once the scientists sent pictures to us ,over time you can see the ""face"" fades out over time."
2677,670f07879dd0,"This means that it did have formed shadows giving illusions of the eyes , mouth , and nose."
2678,c475e64d6a37,To conclude it was not a face-- it was a Mesa.
2679,e08324983079,"In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" the author gives us reasons why exploring Venus would be very difficult."
2680,e08324983079,"But, at the same time, the author gives us reasons why it's important to explore Venus."
2681,e08324983079,"It's because Venus is Earth like, and so we might be able to visit it one day."
2682,3fd72cd25cc5,"The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" states, ""Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally rhe losest in distance too"" This is very important, it means that because that Venus is Earth like, as well as the closest planet to earth at times, its important to learn about it, in case we need to go to it at anytime."
2683,cfc47004659a,"At the end, the artivle also states, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meed the very edges on imagination and innovation."""
2684,8fb76e828119,"This means that even though it's dangerouse to go to Venus, we shouldn't help us hold it back, space is a very dangerous place, and if we let us hold us back, we won't get anywhere, and Fast."
2685,3f076a5b1e71,Did you know that there are car-free cities?
2686,3f076a5b1e71,"In the German suburbs, life goes on without cars and vehicles to use as transportataion."
2687,3f076a5b1e71,"In the outskirts of Freiburg, a lot of things that envolve car use are forbidden."
2688,3f076a5b1e71,Driving in Paris is also banned because of smog.
2689,3f076a5b1e71,"In Bogoto, Columbia, they decided to spead the Day Without Cars to local countries."
2690,3f076a5b1e71,"Near the French and Swiss borders, on the outskirts of Freiburg, street parking, driveways, and home garages are forbidden in the new district."
2691,3f076a5b1e71,"On Vauban's streets, it is almost a car-free area."
2692,3f076a5b1e71,The only vehicle on the streets is the tram that travels to downtown Freiburg and few streets on one edge on the community.
2693,3f076a5b1e71,It's not like the whole idea of cars are forbidden.
2694,3f076a5b1e71,"People are allowed to own cars but, there are only two places to park."
2695,3f076a5b1e71,"""They are allowed to park in large garages at the end of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home"", paragraph 2 states."
2696,a5fddb9b5ca1,Because of the air pollution
2697,771ef5b0ee6f,Paris set up a partial driving ban to clear the air.
2698,771ef5b0ee6f,"On Monday, drivers with a even-numbered license plate have to leave their cars at home or pay a 22-euro fine, which is ($31)."
2699,771ef5b0ee6f,"Close to 4,000 drivers were fined and 27 people had their cars impounded, due to the reaction of the fine."
2700,771ef5b0ee6f,"The good thing about it is, after the change was put into action, congestion went down 60% in the capital of France after 5 days of intensifying the smog."
2701,771ef5b0ee6f,The idea worked perfectly fine and ended up making a great change in France and helped the environment.
2702,6c6150764960,"During a car-free day in Bogota, Columbia, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, and took buses to work."
2703,6c6150764960,The purpose of this action was to control pollution and avoid traffic jams.
2704,6c6150764960,"The Day Without Cars was so effective that, it began spreading to other countires."
2705,6c6150764960,"The turnout was large, people didn't even care about the weather."
2706,6c6150764960,There were just a bunch of people working together for a good cause.
2707,29f8ee914ab0,The outcome took away a lot of stress
2708,ee62f1bb4a1b,"Although, cars are used very often and are a useful form of transportation, they are also very hamful."
2709,ee62f1bb4a1b,Taking a break from driving isn't a bad idea.
2710,4d3df3a4b145,Maybe the people in Florida should consider taking action and having our own care-free day.
2711,4d3df3a4b145,It wouldn't hurt!
2712,4d3df3a4b145,"If anything, i'll help!"
2713,72a0e6a927f6,The summer is a time for students to enjoy a break from schoolwork.
2714,72a0e6a927f6,Most students spend their time on vacation or relaxing.
2715,72a0e6a927f6,"Summer projects may impede on students' time to relax, and they may take away their freedom."
2716,94d64543ccc9,"It is the students' break, so they may want to decide what projects they have to do."
2717,94d64543ccc9,Summer projects should be student-designed
2718,a34153be599b,it allows the students to do projects they are interested in
2719,3a45266c6771,that work with their summer schedule.
2720,84570ac43f6d,Student-designed projects will interest students more than teacher-designed projects.
2721,f4a4ca335730,Many students don't want to do anything school related over the summer.
2722,f4a4ca335730,"By assigning them projects, they have to take time to do something they don't want to do."
2723,f4a4ca335730,"However, if the projects were student-designed, they would be more likely to complete them since they designed them themselves."
2724,f4a4ca335730,"These projects would make the students use their creativity, which would lead to more of them expressing their interests."
2725,f4a4ca335730,They will be much more motivated to do a project that interests them than a project made and given to them by a teacher.
2726,4019dd25a5aa,Many students travel and have plans over the summer.
2727,4019dd25a5aa,"Consequently, they may not have time to do teacher-designed projects."
2728,95333eb4dce1,"If the students designed their own projects, they would be able to design them to fit their schedule."
2729,7927ae3e8bb6,"With this flexibility, students will stress less about finding time for the project."
2730,7927ae3e8bb6,"Therefor, students will produce better projects because they aren't stressed."
2731,7927ae3e8bb6,This flexibility allows students to do their best and get the most out of doing school work in the summer.
2732,118f0e16923f,Many people think that the freedom of student-designed projects will allow students to be lazy and off topic
2733,7701c03ff7d3,"However, this freedom gives the students the opportunity to turn schoolwork into something that interests them, thus motivating them to do well."
2734,1d3f37bb9bf1,The summer is a break for students to relax and not worry about school.
2735,1d3f37bb9bf1,"School projects take away from that, but the student-designed projects give more flexibility than those made by teachers."
2736,1d3f37bb9bf1,"Therefor, summer projects should be student-designed in order to grab students' interest and not impede on their break."
2737,460711c064a1,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"", the author supports the idea of studying Venus through research and data that has been collected thoughout the years."
2738,d0fb46a6c21f,The author made really good points about why we should study Venus despite the dangers that it may hold.
2739,5b929e31c914,The author talked about why Venus is worth studying.
2740,5b929e31c914,"It is said in paragraph 4, that Venus, long ago, may have been earth-like."
2741,5b929e31c914,It may have been covered in oceans and supported life.
2742,5b929e31c914,This is defintely interesting to think about.
2743,5b929e31c914,"If it was like that long ago, why couldn't Venus be inhabitable for humans now?"
2744,5b929e31c914,"On Venus, we would have enough solar power, and radiation levels wouldn't exceed Earth's."
2745,5b929e31c914,I think it would be fascinating to study venus even with the dangers that it may present.
2746,da262c1f0d95,"Overall, the author did a good job at persuading people to want to study Venus despite the challenges that may be faced."
2747,da262c1f0d95,There was a plentiful amount of interesting facts that the average person may have not knew.
2748,01be42e83aad,"After reading this article, I am not fascinated by Venus and what the future intails for us humans."
2749,4f4c5b9f7433,Everyone has a hobby or something they enjoy doing at home why not just do it at school with your friends.
2750,d11823257a13,I agree with the principal for making everyone stay after school for a extracurricular activity

2756,b2b7e839e871,"We are staying healthy by running around and jumping up and down, bringing up are hart rate and sweating."
2757,b2b7e839e871,This is why I think the principal should make everyone stay after school for a extracurricular
2758,ff8f8f41b250,"When you stayed after everyday for weather its a club,sport or another activity there will be other kids, some might be your friend but some you might not know."
2759,ff8f8f41b250,If they are doing the same after school activity you must have some things in common like why your in the same activity so its a easy way to meet new people and friends.
2760,ff8f8f41b250,This is why I think the principal should make everyone stay after school for a extracurricular activity.
2761,cc22b4d09e43,"The after school program is pretty fun because of the verity of activities like sports, dance teams, clubs and more."
2762,cc22b4d09e43,My friends and I like the sports after school because there is soccer and basketball the more kids that stay after the more fun it is because we can have bigger games.
2763,cc22b4d09e43,This is why I think the principal should make everyone stay after school for a extracurricular activity.
2764,b60d0734cf67,"
I agree with the principal making everyone stay after for a extracurricular activity because I think it would keep you active and healthy, meet new people and friends, and have a lot of fun."
2765,b60d0734cf67,There a a big verity of different and fun activities there is probably one just right for you.
2766,e0691c856183,"Over the summer, many schools assign projects in order for students to continue working and learning year round."
2767,e0691c856183,"However, It is an incredibly heated debate as to whether teachers or students should design these assignments."
2768,4c1209daa1c7,Teachers should design the summer projects rather than students
2769,d1eda2ba19de,"they can prepare the students for the upcoming curriculum,"
2770,a49a359249b4,"introduce their style of teaching,"
2771,df01e7d2d806,set expectations for work ethic and quality of work for assignments throughout the year.
2772,53d0547eedfc,Some could argue that it is more beneficial for students to design summer projects because students can make them more enjoyable.
2773,9572542f8681,"However, this should not be the case because it compromises the whole point of summer assignments."
2774,9572542f8681,"If students were to create them, the content of the assignments would not be as helpful."
2775,9572542f8681,Summer projects are not necessarily about being enjoyable.
2776,9572542f8681,Their purpose is to ensure that students do not become to accustomed to doing nothing over the extensive period of wasted time called summer break.
2777,9572542f8681,They keep students tethered to reality and are reminders that the beginning of school is nigh.
2778,9572542f8681,They are helpful because they keep students' brains used to learning and working over the summer in order to make the start of the new year less painful.
2779,9572542f8681,Teachers need to design the summer projects to ensure that the assignments retain their purpose and that they are helpful in keeping students busy over the summer.
2780,9572542f8681,"If a student designed them, they would not be as serious or helpful, and they would lose their purpose."
2781,9085181fe2f7,"For example, if there was a summer project for a chemistry class, the teacher would want to develop it so that it relates to the upcoming curriculum and provides a good introduction for the year."
2782,9085181fe2f7,"So, perhaps the teacher would assign work on the basic topics of chemistry, namely what an atom is and what the parts are, the periodic table, nomenclature, and simple chemical reactions."
2783,9085181fe2f7,"By doing so, students begin the school year with knowledge that can allow them to grasp the later curriculum with more speed and ease."
2784,9085181fe2f7,"Summer projects are perfect for setting the foundation for the school year, laying the ground upon which the building of knowledge can rise."
2785,9085181fe2f7,"Teachers are the only ones who can create the most efficient and effective summer projects to maximize their students success, considering they know the material like the back of their hand and they are the ones who are teaching it."
2786,7288ea3d8ae7,"It can be a shock, for some students, starting the school year blindly without any hints as to how the teacher is going to relay the curriculum to them."
2787,7288ea3d8ae7,"For example, one teacher may enjoy using textbooks to teach the subject, so he or she might assign pages to read or even a problem set for the summer."
2788,7288ea3d8ae7,"On the other hand, a teacher may prefer lectures, hands on learning, or visual learning."
2789,7288ea3d8ae7,"A summer project could match the teachers style of teaching, providing a proper introduction to the school year."
2790,7288ea3d8ae7,"Therefore, only teachers themselves can create a summer project that is successful in reflecting their personal style of teaching."
2791,7288ea3d8ae7,"This allows the students to know what to expect when starting the new year, and can lead to more success, more confidence, and less anxiety about staring anew with a teacher."
2792,9ca7fdc00640,"Along with a summer assignment, a teacher could attach a rubric, for example, to clearly state what he or she expects out of a student."
2793,9ca7fdc00640,"They can highlight how much effort the class requires, and state that students should put pride and care into all of their assignments throughout the year."
2794,9ca7fdc00640,"If these expectations are not created over the summer, the beginning of the school year could be rough for students if they are not sure about how demanding each assignment is."
2795,9ca7fdc00640,"By the teachers designing the summer projects, they can eliminate any confusion students may have over the summer, resulting in a smoother transition into the school year."
2796,15c8679a6f0b,"teachers should design summer projects in order to prepare students for the year, introduce themselves and their style of teaching, and set the expectations for the school year."
2797,15c8679a6f0b,"Think about the real purpose of summer assignments: to make sure students are still learning over break, and though summer assignments may not be enjoyable, they are invaluable and indispensable to the school year, so they must be created by teachers in order to assure their effectiveness."
2798,d9e456a4e605,Some schools require that students complete projects over the summer.
2799,d9e456a4e605,"In my personal experience, they have all been teacher-designed,"
2800,289b0e2492ec,what if summer projects were mostly student-designed?
2801,289b0e2492ec,The more you think about it the more it makes sense.
2802,8642b853a27f,"more interesting and engaging for students,"
2803,452fd0e5d5c1,a compelling scientific foundation for its effects on childrens' learning.
2804,bd7e38f04edc,This is mostly due to the fact that students can choose the things that better relate to their interests.
2805,bd7e38f04edc,They become interested in both the project and the relevant part of the curriculum.
2806,bd7e38f04edc,Applying the information you learned in previous school year is an excellent way to test what you've learned - and applying it to something you genuinely care about is the best test of your understanding.
2807,bd7e38f04edc,"Also, people must be interested in a project before they can be enthusiastic (or willing at the least) to engage with the it, and everyone knows that engagement is a good thing for learning."
2808,bd7e38f04edc,"Students incorporating something into their break makes them even more likely to do it, a fact that has had especially important bearing for me this last year, where it's been challenging to stay on top of the workload."
2809,bd7e38f04edc,"The few times I've taken some days off to relax, I noticed that it was comparatively really difficult to get myself to do stuff when starting again."
2810,bd7e38f04edc,I feel even more apprehensive if I get out of the habit entirely.
2811,bd7e38f04edc,"It's simple: when you give a student a break, they're more likely to engage in school projects if they feels like a part of their break, so not only does letting students design their own projects provide quality, but quantity."
2812,bd7e38f04edc,"Here's an example which fits perfectly with what I'm saying: I walked into my History of the Americas class at the beginning of the year, and many of my peers who were top students had not finished reading the books they were assigned during the summer and fudged the details on the accompanying paper."
2813,bd7e38f04edc,"When listening to them, the most common remarks were about how dry and uninteresting the prescribed book list was and how having to do it in the summer was an annoyance that they just wanted to put off."
2814,bd7e38f04edc,"Meanwhile, most student-designed projects I know of provide much better learning and motivation."
2815,bd7e38f04edc,"The biggest example I've in my mind when writing this is my experience with the I'm in the IB program, where students are required to complete an

Extended Essay, a 16 - 20 page paper on a subject of your choice."
2816,bd7e38f04edc,"Because I can do mine on the physics and mathematics of a diabolo (similar to a yo-yo), and I spend a lot of my free time invested in this object anyway, I've never looked forwards to a project so much in my life (not to mention I love math and problem solving)!"
2817,bd7e38f04edc,"I started last summer by doing some experiments, and have since been leaning towards the math side to discover new math (like the calculus in a Lagrangian) and push myself, actually using what I've learned in school."
2818,634847442ae2,The opportunity for involvement and motivation offered by student-designed projects (especially during the summer) is great enough that I believe it would be worth it for teachers to adopt in place of more traditional assignments.
2819,119d4b07bd9a,"Some people say summer projects have to support the student for the rigor of the following school year, and that student designed projects will not demand the same skills needed to prepare them for the next year."
2820,119d4b07bd9a,"Therefore, teachers instead of students should make summer assignments"
2821,a421b2e97543,"But to the contrary, a large body of evidence supports that with minimal guidance from the teacher over the summer, taking longer breaks from hard and tiresome work isn't that detrimental for your learning."
2822,e2f9324b0979,"While I realize that student-designed projects may fall short in providing the work ethic needed for the following year, I don't think that's the point of summer work."
2823,3b4eae67823c,The point is that you take a long break to refresh you for the next year so you don't burnout (e. g. senioritis).
2824,3b4eae67823c,"Furthermore, most people figure out how to keep up with the workload by the end of the following year anyways."
2825,3b4eae67823c,"And, even if students make it slightly easier, it is still reflective the curriculum - and in the long run it's that knowledge that matters, especially later in life."
2826,3b4eae67823c,"Likewise, if students can put it off for a month or so, that isn't really a bad thing."
2827,3b4eae67823c,"Spacing, or leaving what learning and then coming back to it right when you're almost forgetting it, is one of the most scientifically backed learning techniques we know of."
2828,3b4eae67823c,"In one study, students were asked to memorize words in Spanish, but split into multiple groups."
2829,3b4eae67823c,"As compared to the control of 8 hours of straight studying, the group that studied four hours, then four hours an entire month later, did over twice as well on a test of that vocabulary after the study."
2830,92639d48a094,"Because of the clear benefits of avoiding burnout and spacing, it's best if students take advantage of the freedom how they feel, so long as they engage with something"
2831,a4d71621139c,"Student-designed projects that can spark student's creativity also help teachers, since it's much easier and safer for them just to let a student create it themselves."
2832,a4d71621139c,"Sure, there is a chance the teacher might get it right, but it's not guaranteed."
2833,a4d71621139c,"And finally, there's nothing to lose."
2834,a4d71621139c,"Yes, kids might cram it in the week before break ends, but remember that most kids already do that."
2835,a4d71621139c,"It's fair to say that student-designed projects are a win for learning, creativity, teachers, and students alike that we're missing out on."
2836,a4d71621139c,"Student-designed projects both prepare students better for the next year while helping them consolidate what they've learned previously better than most teacher made assignment ever could, with few exceptions."
2837,a4d71621139c,"So, while I don't think that student-designed projects are the key to perfect learning, but they are definitely a part of it."
2838,5ccfa9ecbd7d,Think about walking into your second period class and you have a test.
2839,5ccfa9ecbd7d,This is a test that you have to pass but you have no clue what the test is going to be over.
2840,5ccfa9ecbd7d,You sit down and your heart starts pounding so fast that you feel sick to your stomach.
2841,5ccfa9ecbd7d,You're so scared to take this test because your not sure if you're going to pass it or not.
2842,5ccfa9ecbd7d,"""You make begin"", your teacher says."
2843,5ccfa9ecbd7d,Reading a few questions in your head and you dont know any of the answers.
2844,5ccfa9ecbd7d,Have you ever thought about technology being able to help you?
2845,5ccfa9ecbd7d,Should technology be able to read students emontional expressions?
2846,e8986d30c9cb,The Facial Action Coding System is a 3D computer model of the face.
2847,e8986d30c9cb,It uses your facial muscles to determand how your feeling.
2848,e8986d30c9cb,For example if you are feeling anger the computer would know because your orbicularis oris tightens your lips to show the anger.
2849,e8986d30c9cb,This device would be able to be showed by a real face or even a painting like the Mona Lisa.
2850,e8986d30c9cb,This computer can even show mixed emotions.
2851,9364c35f7263,Technology is a valuable resource for students.
2852,9364c35f7263,"The new technology called the ""Facial Actions Coding System"" would be great for students."
2853,8211d75967ef,"This is something that will be able to read your face and let people know if your bored, tired, happy, sad, and it even shows your fears."
2854,8211d75967ef,If your stuggling on a test or an assignment it will give you help and walk you through some of the problems.
2855,8211d75967ef,This would help many students understand the concept and test scores would be so much higher.
2856,9bb934910140,According to the article people are able to tell if you are having a bad day.
2857,03c1631e4b75,People can not tell what is wrong with you just because you look sad or upset.
2858,03c1631e4b75,Vinci studied human anatomy to help paint facial muscles that can convey certain emotions.
2859,03c1631e4b75,If you look at the painting of Mona Lisa you would be able to tell from her facial strututres of what type of mood she is trying to show.
2860,03c1631e4b75,"When looking at the Mona Lisa , it really intended to make you smile and in a happy mood."
2861,2e9b4637c93c,The FACS would benfit alot of students in the world.
2862,ada4d3f8fe9e,Do you think this would be a good idea?
2863,ada4d3f8fe9e,"In the reading Making Mona Lisa Smile by Nick D'Alto, Mona Lisa is mostly happy a little disgusted and a little fearful and a little angry this is about mixed emotions and coming up with a new technology about reading yoiur emotions and calculating them for you to see whos really happy or faking happiness."
2864,ada4d3f8fe9e,This is about calculating emotions on a three D computer.
2865,0c8d2cec6df8,"First off, Mona Lisa is mostly always happy and she wanted to come up with a way to see if a lot of school students are happy or just faking there happiniss and hiding there real emotions."
2866,35b75e38c39e,there is this three D computer that can take calculations on your emotions and tell you if you are truly happy or hiding your real emotions.
2867,e93f2a007f74,"secendly, theres ba computer that contructs a three-D model of the face and all 44 major muscles in the model must move around like the human muscles."
2868,e93f2a007f74,"there are six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear and sadness the three-D computer can detect all six of these emotions and calculate the emotions and tell you how you really feel."
2869,65674f84f35b,you can tell when someone is truly smiling because there muscles in there face move a serten way and if it is a fake smile your muscles move a different way therefore you can tell if the smile is fake or not.
2870,55e340049e83,"Therefore, yes i think this new technology would work because the three-D model can detect the true feelings you have and calculate it"
2871,97e79cb8892e,i think you shoukd try this if you ever get a chance.
2872,93daab2cccb6,"Venus, otherwise known as the ""Evening Star,"" is one of the more challenging planets to examine closely in our solar system."
2873,93daab2cccb6,"While this plant is often called Earth's twin, it is vastly different in terms of environment and hospitability."
2874,93daab2cccb6,"Despite being the closest planet to Earth at times, no spaceship has touched down on Venus in over thirty years."
2875,93daab2cccb6,"The dangers presented by Venus are many, but the author greatly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite these dangers."
2876,09116a76686d,The author supports this claim by stating that the insight to be gained is significant and by offering methods for obtaining these insights despite the danger that is readily appearant.
2877,a0b1dcf80174,Venus is one of the most challenging planets to examine due to its very extreme environment
2878,245a1d5c653a,Paragraph 3 of the article is all about the extreme environment that Venus presents.
2879,245a1d5c653a,"Venus has temperatures over 800 degress Fahrenheit, an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than that on Earth, erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and other obstacles that prove challenging for scientists to overcome."
2880,245a1d5c653a,"Additionally, Venus has clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere which prove to be challenging to scientists."
2881,245a1d5c653a,"These dangers may seem impossible to overcome, but scientists have been developing new methods to further their knowledge of Venus."
2882,cd81d474dd25,NASA is one organization that has been developing particularly interesting ideas about how to further study Venus.
2883,ce075e40ddaa,They are considering a blimp-like vehicle that would float above the suface of Venus to meet the challenges presented.
2884,ce075e40ddaa,This blimp would avoid the poor conditions of the Venusian landscape by floating some thirty miles above the surface.
2885,ce075e40ddaa,"Conditions around the blimp would still be slightly hot, but the pressure and toxicity would be similar to that on Earth."
2886,ce075e40ddaa,"These conditions are not ideal, but they would be sufficient enough to study Venus further."
2887,ce075e40ddaa,Another one of NASA's ideas is to use mechanical computers to study Venus.
2888,ce075e40ddaa,"These mechanical computers do not require electronics, and they would be more resistant to the poor conditions of the surface."
2889,ce075e40ddaa,These new innovations in the study of Venus is what makes the dangers tolerable and the study worthy.
2890,01a3094587cc,"According to the article, astronomers are interested in Venus because it was likely the most Earth-like planet in the solar system at one point."
2891,862ca28001d4,Venus used to be covered in oceans and supported life.
2892,862ca28001d4,"Additionally, Venus still has features that are similar to Earth's such as a rocky sediment with valleys, mountains, and craters."
2893,862ca28001d4,Insight into the Venusian landscape would further allow astronomers to determine how closely related Earth and Venus were.
2894,862ca28001d4,The author also states that humans should not be limited by their fear to go out and explore.
2895,862ca28001d4,"In the final paragraph of the article, the author describes how human curiosity will lead humans into many intimidating expidentures."
2896,862ca28001d4,"However, the author believes that travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited simply due to danger, and humans should travel as far as their innovation will take them."
2897,1f97d2539040,The author of this article supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers by stating the insight to be gained from further exploring Venus and by presenting new methods that are making new insights possible.
2898,1f97d2539040,"The danger of Venus is extensive due to the high temperatures, extreme atmospheric pressure, and wild weather patterns."
2899,1f97d2539040,These obstacles are being dealt with though by new ideas from scientists at NASA.
2900,1f97d2539040,One big idea from NASA is the idea to use a blimp to observe Venus from above the surface.
2901,1f97d2539040,Another idea of theirs is to use materials that would be able to withstand the extreme conditions of the Venusian environment.
2902,1f97d2539040,All this is in the hopes that futher insight will be made on the planet that once was the most Earth-like planet in the solar system.
2903,8eb4bc7e2f34,"First, how does this new technology work"
2904,b1ea14a7d002,the values it has in the schools
2905,698978a1f783,it can make it easier detect someones emotions.
2906,0a255613746c,This is why technology that reads emotions can be very useful
2907,4cd0f3d67447,"First, how would the new technology detect the emotions?"
2908,4cd0f3d67447,The Facial Action Coding System is how
2909,60397ce81807,This innovation was created by Dr. Paul Eckman.
2910,60397ce81807,The process starts with the computer constructing 3-D model of faces.
2911,60397ce81807,"It also, models the 44 major muscles that have to move like humans."
2912,60397ce81807,"By using video imagery, the software tracks the facial movement to recognize the emotions."
2913,881925683d10,"Second, the effects it has on the school could be outstanding."
2914,2f13413c4513,What if the school computers could tell a student's emotions?
2915,2f13413c4513,The computer could recognize if the student is bored or confused.
2916,2f13413c4513,The computer could modify what the student is learning to something more effective.
2917,2f13413c4513,"This way would be easier on the teacher, so they won't have to come up with new lesson plans."
2918,5a3d34275ab5,"
Third, it can easily detect someones emotions."
2919,2cb7ba0ba349,They have used the new technology on Leonardo da Vinci panting of Mona Lisa.
2920,2cb7ba0ba349,In the painting it's kind of hard to tell her emotions.
2921,2cb7ba0ba349,"The new technology find she's 83%, happy 9% disguted, 6% fearful, and 2% angry."
2922,2cb7ba0ba349,"If this technology can detect a painting emotions like this easily, just imagine how easy it would be to detect on a human."
2923,b155550a59e1,"
In Conclusion, technology that reads emotions can be very useful."
2924,b155550a59e1,"First, how it's uesd."
2925,b155550a59e1,"second, the value it has in schools."
2926,b155550a59e1,"Third,it can make it easier to detect someones emotion."
2927,bee18f37c961,Persuading a person involves tons of effort and time.
2928,bee18f37c961,You have to know your facts and have tons of background knowlege on the subject.
2929,bee18f37c961,Do you personally believe in aliens?
2930,637428649c30,"The so called ""face"" provided in the image is what I believe a natural landform, although some peoples thoughts differ"
2931,125c4863041b,If you look at the image that was revealed by NASA you will see there are no realistic features to it
2932,c899f0395728,Do you ever come across a person with a square or retangular head?
2933,c899f0395728,"Well, I have not."
2934,4d0ef84227da,Aliens aren't realistic
2935,5e83b8c01c29,"The presents of aliens are said to be there, but realisitcally have you ever personally came across a alien or even evidence to a aliens presents?"
2936,ec6838da4b16,"As we come to unmask the face on Mars the gravitational pull has formed the ""face"" on Mars by waste build up."
2937,ec6838da4b16,"Aliens are fictional creatures that live in movies and tv shows, not in the real world."
2938,d0247705c7ee,Do you agree or disagree having technology read to students emotional expressions?
2939,d0247705c7ee,"Imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions."
2940,d0247705c7ee,New software has been developed that improves accurancy in perceiving the emotions of others.
2941,d0247705c7ee,"This new software, the Facial Action Coding

System, has promising applications for a variety of industries."
2942,7b60ceb389e8,I personality will like to have technology to read my emotional expressions .
2943,7b60ceb389e8,it would be fun to have that in school .
2944,33f4e6bbd060,It shows just how much this computer can do.
2945,33f4e6bbd060,Imagine a computer that knows when your're happy or sad.
2946,30aab6bd714e,"''The same technology can make computer- animated faces more expressive - for video games or video surgery'' said Dr,Huang."
2947,30aab6bd714e,Dr. Huang and his colleague experts are developing better ways for humans and computer to communicate.
2948,30aab6bd714e,The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like a human muscules.
2949,30aab6bd714e,"It haves Six basic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness- and then associasted each with characterisctic movments of the facial muscles."
2950,6412caa8de03,This is how it works It's all about those muscular action units.
2951,d0d2e52fb73d,They even indicate the difference between a genuine smlie and a forced one.
2952,d0d2e52fb73d,"In the real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles taht begin at your cheek bones) lift the corner of your mouth."
2953,d0d2e52fb73d,(That's our instruction #1.)
2954,d0d2e52fb73d,Muscles are called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes.
2955,d0d2e52fb73d,(That's instruction #2.)
2956,cbe62be10453,I agree that students should have this Facial Action Coding System in schools.
2957,cbe62be10453,Not only well it help by reading emotions but it may also help for students that want to be actors and people that like doing art and like painting faces.
2958,cbe62be10453,"Dr. Huang and his colleague are very smart for making

The Facial Action Coding System for school."
2959,b7959c42b1d2,The Author supports this idea because he or she says Venus is too dangerous for astronuts to go to and study.
2960,a66d4303d2fb,"So The author says that NASA is working on a Robot, to send into Space, to Venus"
2961,b6c331dd8814,Nasa is doing this so They don't have to got on Venus in person instead they are using a robot to gather information baout Venus.
2962,295bf8aedbee,The Author Also says that since venus is very dangerous
2963,a961303c80bd,the Robot can study the plant while the astromistes stay on earth and they can egt data about venus thanks to the Robot.
2964,a961303c80bd,The Author says that NASA is always inventing new ways to get information from space and plants without doing it in person.
2965,ffffb3b11d6c,I fell like the author is correct about these staements because Space and the other plants are not safe for humans to even step foot on.
2966,a7920cadc969,When the Author says that technolgy will be your best friends for ching out space and the other plants and get information for you the auther is correct.
2967,3f7f276fd88f,"Sometimes something happens like sometime their computer act up or they need to be replaced so sometimes they are not reciving information from the robots and it makes it very diffcault to see what is happing in Space, and what is happing on the Plants."
2968,3f7f276fd88f,So sometimes the astronuts would have to go into space and retreve the robots themselfs and bring them back to earth so they can fix them if the robot is broken
2969,a8382220949c,The technology that is being deveolped is valuable
2970,eb68e7e6110f,because in situations wehn someone doesnt want to talk or refuse to in a crisis they can read ther emotions and seek a better way of talking with them.
2971,d1abe33355a5,also a lot of schools do a horrible almost a illegal jobs and reading kids emotions and helping there students
2972,8b426111f23b,if this technology was used in schools teachers might actually have a chance at doing there jobs which they need to get better soon.
2973,5717b54c754e,this topic is useful in a lot of ways hostage situations interagations helping disabled people in schools which we all know need help this program could do wonders for people
2974,396ad83f3dc6,but if they use it to much and make it to logical we could lose sight of how to properly use it
2975,3cdaa4b6ee95,to many rules treating to many people the same would destory it because everyones different even if they feel the same way as other people some have a chip on ther shoulder and others own the world to many differences to make this system properly work and functio in a way we all wish it could but it would be to complex and overcompilcated might be a fun app on your phone but not for statewide adminastraion use it would be corrupt and wrong it would only be used to hurt not help
2976,9d81d472f41d,Citizens cars are good to have but all the fines and stress they are putting on us makes us not wont to buy a car.
2977,1421991d80c5,But now i see we need to have a change and just start walking and finding another way other then our cars
2978,04276f8d7399,they are talking about fining and impounding our cars the ones (Cars) we paid full cash for.
2979,fd045b4db935,"accroding to the article in ''Life Goes On Without Cars'', u could park at a garage but its gotta be ownship and u would have to buy space that cost $40,000, along with a home."
2980,fd045b4db935,"For example, u would have to buy a house pay for that rent and also pay for the parking fee that u brought with the house."
2981,fd045b4db935,"So with that being said u should just buy a house, and not own a car and just walk, ride a bike ,or take a bus to where every u got to go."
2982,fd045b4db935,"Secondly, now there saying in article ''Driving due to smog'' On Monday motorists with-numbered licence plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine($31).The same would apply to odd-numbered plated the following the day."
2983,fd045b4db935,"That's not right because you brought your  car, but you could only drive it a certain day (would ever the law says)."
2984,fd045b4db935,"The understanding that I'm getting is you got to follow the law rules when ever that applies to the goverment people, which is understandable."
2985,fd045b4db935,But my point is I brought my car and i should be able to drive my car when ever I feel like it.
2986,fd045b4db935,"Futher more, Now they  want to have a ''Car Free Day'' In the article Car-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota, they say millions of Colombins hiked, biked, skated, or took buses to work during a car-free yesterday, leaving the streets of this capital city eerily devoid of traffic jams."
2987,fd045b4db935,"For example, If the people did drive on a car-free day they would face $25 fine."
2988,fd045b4db935,"So if it rained and u needed to get somewhere you could't drive u would have to take a bus, walk, train, or skate."
2989,fd045b4db935,Or you would be fined.
2990,e97b99d87993,"from the understanding that I'm getting,  I advise everyone to take the bus,walk,skate,bike,or hike just to get to where you got to be also you could just not own a car."
2991,e97b99d87993,"Because either way, if u break the rules you are going to be to be fine or  they could impounded your car and thats would be a lot of mess  becasue you paid for a car but u gotta pay the fine and pay to get your car out the impounded."
2992,e97b99d87993,"So EVERYONE just walk,bike,hike,skate,or take a train or bus."
2993,7be5d9bc7345,Have you ever wondered about Venus?
2994,7be5d9bc7345,This planet is somthing that we as humans haven't figured out yet.
2995,7be5d9bc7345,"We are facing the challenge of Venus, it is really valued not only because of the facts and information we get out of this planet."
2996,7be5d9bc7345,"Instead, humans are curiose and looking for more evidence of what we are going to face in the futur"
2997,63930cc58cbc,"We should learn more not only on the outter shell, but more deeply in the inside."

3006,c1d4c109e92f,"If we could lend on Venus later on in the generation, could there be any living organisum that lives on that plante?"
3007,c1d4c109e92f,There could be a possible chance since Earth is not the only planet in space.
3008,c1d4c109e92f,There are more things tha we need to discover.
3009,dac2148d87e8,You would never know if there are creatures like ous that have a abiliy to explore space.
3010,dac2148d87e8,We should keep trying even if there is only a 0.0000001 chance.
3011,88cf1833cb70,There are many advantages of limiting car usage
3012,e6f190f2e08f,less smog or pollution
3013,1af62b0f3736,stores would be places in walking distance
3014,a30a526884f5,it saves time because there is less traffic

3042,bd70ee037a64,I feel like it should and here's why.
3043,7fc088314355,First of all what happen is someone is depress and dont want to tell anyone about it so they kill their self because they're depress
3044,035e3f2721a5,the facial Action Coding System could have help that poor boy or girl because someone would ask her what's wrong and talk about it with him or her and know they feel that someone there for them and how much they're needed and wanted so they don't kill there self matter as fact there are happy right now because someone is there for them and they feel wanted and they can love life agian.
3045,40bbf086a867,"My evidence why I wrote that satatment is the passage it said ""she's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry"" I think everyone should have this because it could save a lot of people lives because so many people take their lives away so fast and young because of depresion and lot are teens if high schools and jr high haves these i feel like it would change the world for the better"
3046,ae2a5f7ad531,Some peolpe don't like it mabye it's because they're the stress ones that need help and think that no one cares and is to scared to show they're depress and they rather keep to them self.
3047,f8787213849d,My oppoion is that every school and family doctor should have this to save lives and more.
3048,64ecf5561020,"Every summer, millions of students flood from their school buildings, on their way to about 100 straight days away from any form of academia."
3049,64ecf5561020,"With the traditional school system having been around for decades, educators and social science researchers alike have longed for a way to strike a balance between learning and leisure during summer vacation."
3050,64ecf5561020,"Within just a few moments of deliberation, one will realize that summer projects are a near perfect answer to supplement this lack of learning."
3051,0cc83664dd4e,"To make most effective use of their time in the summer, kids should conduct student-

designed projects."
3052,7890de100f2b,"It's through this process that students will become more engaged with the learning material,"
3053,5063f82a0163,"produce higher quality work,"
3054,ccb16449c4f3,begin to store information in their long term memory.
3055,953671f9bda8,One of the major gripes students have begun to have with school is undoubtedly the lack a independence as it applies to their learning experience.
3056,5b53740d34e6,"It forces children not only to display their knowledge of course material, but to apply said knowledge in a creative setting that requires a ""bigger picture"" understanding of the given topic."
3057,5b53740d34e6,It goes without saying that students will take greater pride in their own work.
3058,5b53740d34e6,They'll want to show up on the first day of school with a project that they feel proud to present to their peers.
3059,afc3da778f27,"When all the work is theirs, students will feel increasingly inclined to show that they have a full understanding and mastery of the topic."
3060,afc3da778f27,"Nobody wants to feel left out, and, especially as kids age and progress higher up through the school system, the way classmates perceive one another becomes all too important."
3061,4986cdb419aa,"With recent generations of learners displaying less and less focus throughout the years, some might to disprove the effectiveness of student based projects."
3062,4986cdb419aa,"""Given full control over the projects parameters,"" one might claim, ""students will become far too focused on obsolete details like font, backgrounds, and pictures."""
3063,4986cdb419aa,Someone who might hold this point of view believes a hands-off approach from teachers will only result in lower quality work and declining focus on the course material.
3064,cc6e5cc9812b,"However, we can observe time and time again in every day life that critical-thinking tasks can teach skills at an exponentially greater rate."
3065,cc6e5cc9812b,"Take an athlete for example, basketball and soccer players will often dribble while counting the number of fingers a partner holds up in front of them."
3066,cc6e5cc9812b,"Just like in a school setting, this exercise builds good habits and requires people to apply their newly learned skills in unfamiliar circumstances."
3067,d05e072166a5,It's through a plethora of ways that student driven learning can benefit school systems around the world.
3068,d05e072166a5,More effective forms of education during the summer are invaluable in cutting down the amount of start up time at the beginning of any given school year where teachers struggle to prime their students for the year ahead.
3069,d05e072166a5,"In place of the traditional project type, designed by teachers and administrators, more free reign forms of summer education produce a more enjoyable learning experience and prompt kids to retain far more knowledge than they would before."
3070,d05e072166a5,"Overall, a shift towards more student liberties in this day in age could see monumental benefits for everyone involved in and around modern public schools."

3083,6cb0e910b214,"The liability insurance is good too, but it does not cover that much if a person gets involved in a car accident."

3099,682492ee367c,Many would say that this is a reasonable excuse but risking the life of an innocent drier is not acceptable.
3100,d1a1e98a5e1b,"Therefore, texting and riving should be illegal because insurance rates raise in price, it is against moral conduct, and it is the reason many people die."
3101,d1a1e98a5e1b,Distracted driving could be the cause of many fatalities but placing the phone down while driving could save millions.

3103,2e09fa904c3d,I am going to be telling you what i think of technology being able to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom and if i think it is valueable.
3104,64ec8aa51bda,I think technology reading people emotional expressions is valuable but then again i don't think is is valuable

3131,850a8205f3bb,"One person can start a revolution for their community, city, or state."
3132,850a8205f3bb,If everyone all over the world could do this we would reduce tons of greenhouse gases amd smog.
3133,850a8205f3bb,We can make earth a better place and more healthy enviroment.
3134,0b6050e9f412,If the usage of cars are limited their would be less greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
3135,8d943bd5d32e,Greenhouse gasses are responsible for global warning and the melting of the polar ice caps.
3136,8d943bd5d32e,If you limit the amount of car usage their would be less cars on the road and it would by a lot quieter at night.
3137,8d943bd5d32e,In some parts of the United States 50% of the greenhouse gas emissions are from passender cars.
3138,8d943bd5d32e,thats a sign that we need to stop relying on cars so much.
3139,8d943bd5d32e,"The fact is that if were our passenger cars are giving off that much greenhouse gasses, than our cars are giving off the most greenhouse gasses and its time to make a change."
3140,2a0ad5b0f9cc,If you want to help cut back on the greenhouse gas emission than only use your car if your giong a far distance.
3141,6235c8be2580,"you dont need to use your car to go down the street, or around the block."
3142,243ffe40ff29,You should use your car to go anywhere in your neighborhood thats walking distance
3143,7b484f508883,So next time your about to get in your car think about if you really need to take your car.
3144,29e79551a0f8,"Venus is the closest planet to us in our solar system, which means we should explore it."
3145,29e79551a0f8,"At least, that is what the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" believes."
3146,9fb212b33e19,he does not support this claim very well
3147,12d6f288ddba,"as he gives only one vague reason to explore it,"
3148,b9aacc61f081,"he names several dangers and obstacles of exploring it,"
3149,58e37a114811,provides very few actual solutions.
3150,3e930b02b9ca,"First of all, he does a good job of naming the several dangers and obstacles of exploring Venus"
3151,e20e01a5aa65,such as the extreme atmosphiric pressure.
3152,e20e01a5aa65,"The main problem though, is the temperature wich as the author states, ""average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit,"" (Paragraph 3)."
3153,e20e01a5aa65,This poses a problem as most metals and other materials melt at such high temperatures.
3154,e20e01a5aa65,"However, the author fails to give very many solutions to these issues."
3155,758a8e4c729a,The author only provides two solutions to the numerous problems that he previously stated.
3156,b8d66952c3e3,"Those solutions were to stay above the atmosphere where it is not as hot, and to create mechanical computers that were more reinforced."
3157,b8d66952c3e3,"These solutions would be all well and good had he not brought up a problem with the first in which he states ""peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only little insight on ground conditions"" (Paragraph 6) thus, it is not a true solution to the problem at hand."
3158,b8d66952c3e3,But maybe there is good reasons to keep trying to come up with new ways to explore Venus.
3159,72a71aa1f3c6,"Sadly, the author only provides one vague reason for which scientists should still try to come up with new ways to explore Venus."
3160,e49e5971c7ca,"This reason of his is,""It may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" (Paragraph 4)."
3161,e49e5971c7ca,The problem with this is that it does not go very deep into why it being similar to Earth matters.
3162,e49e5971c7ca,"A scientist at NASA might understand any signifigance in that statement, but an average person might not."
3163,e49e5971c7ca,For that reason it is a very weak argument.
3164,214d1b4269eb,"In short, The author does not support his idea for exploring Venus very well because he only gives one vague reason to explore it and he names several dangers and obstacles of exploring it while providing very few actual solutions."
3165,214d1b4269eb,Had he named more solutions and reasons to explore Venus it would have supported his idea far more.
3166,214d1b4269eb,"He named too many dangers without ways to properly combat them, which is why the author's support for his claim was weak."
3167,4eda9f5e7df3,"It is the last day of school, the only thing on your mind is your exciting vacation and the warm weather, the only time that you are free from teachers telling you to what to do and when to do it."
3168,4eda9f5e7df3,When all of a sudden your teacher says that you have a long and tedious project that is due at the end of summer
3169,b937d44426a1,"As a response to this, I argue that students should be the ones designing these projects"
3170,62d0359ca774,"in order to increase specific skills,"
3171,ed786500f0a6,bolster creativity
3172,518920255c76,gain experience designing the project.
3173,f12f7357ff4d,"Throughout the school year, projects that are assigned by teachers don't capture student's true capabilities and skills."
3174,f12f7357ff4d,"However, if students designed their own projects, they could finally display their strengths, which would lead to an increase in motivation for perfecting the project"
3175,e0a78c86e38f,"Furthermore, students have responsibilities and activities during the summer that may cause a low quality project to emerge if they don't have much motivation."
3176,e0a78c86e38f,"For example, students who compete in the school science fair do very well because designing your own project increases motivation for yielding a higher quality project."
3177,2b587813d5ad,"
I once heard, ""necessity is the mother of invention."""
3178,2b587813d5ad,"This quote is indicating that when their is high demand for something, or if someone is wondering how or why something works, new inventions and innovations are made."
3179,2b587813d5ad,"When considering projects, the same rule applies; questioning what you are interested in yields innovation that have built this country since day one."
3180,2b587813d5ad,"For example, Bill Gates wouldn't have founded Microsoft is he didn't research and look into what he was interested in."
3181,a011f9e8f219,"This proves that when students create their own projects based on questioning and logic, their is a greater chance for success."
3182,466f34b040a5,"During the school year, everything is designed by teachers: tests, projects and homework."
3183,466f34b040a5,"In response to this, I raise an important question, how do you expect us to be the next generation of well rounded and intelligent people, when we have been told what to do and when to do it since day one?"
3184,466f34b040a5,"The only way to give students this freedom of choosing how to design the project without disrupting normal school schedule, is to assign it in the summer"
3185,c5691320c183,"Not only does this bolster self thinking and creativity, but also it utilizes the summer months, a long period of time, to think about and develop this project."
3186,9103f424b326,"In response to the question of giving students the right to design their own projects, I argue that in order to increase specific skills, bolster creativity, and gain experience, the best choice is to give students this ability to design their own projects."
3187,9103f424b326,"In general, these skills will help students prepare for adult life, where they will need the specific skills that are full filed through this project."
3188,74643f8df3ae,In the first story it is talking about how cars aren't really drivin near the French and Swiss.
3189,74643f8df3ae,"Though theyallow the cars they just allow them to be parked in only two places: the car-owner buys a space or it to, $40,000 along with the home, or large garages at the edge of the development."
3190,74643f8df3ae,"David Goldberg said "" All of our development since World War ll has been centered on the car, and that will have to change."""
3191,74643f8df3ae,"Paris, France has enforeced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the gobal city."
3192,74643f8df3ae,"Diesel fuel was blamed, since diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in the Western Europe."
3193,74643f8df3ae,"In Bogota, Colombia they ban cars altogether."
3194,74643f8df3ae,they go rid of the roads and made them into sidwalks.
3195,74643f8df3ae,Now that people have to walk to get to their final destination a lot of people now go to the parks and to the sports centers that they have there.
3196,74643f8df3ae,President Obama's goals are to curb the United States ' greenhouse gas emissions will get a fortuitous assit from the incipient shift in American behavior.
3197,74643f8df3ae,Obama said that if we Americans buy less cars then there would be less drivers lisenes each year and fewer driving altoether.
3198,b008e96d8ccb,This might be a good way to help stop school shootings
3199,b0915082cfa8,You can identify which studnet needs help and can go and talk to that student .
3200,2cf0505205e6,Being able to read emotions can be helpful but it may also be distracting.
3201,a89c3be3e838,"For example"" the student appering unintrested and or bored and it automanically changes to a video game"" ?"
3202,a89c3be3e838,Some student are special needs or may be thinking about something happing at home or maybe what's for lunch ?
3203,a89c3be3e838,", and the next thing they see is their work has been erased and or changed and they can do nothing about it and send them into a panick attack and can not focus on anything except trying to calm down."
3204,4f8f054114be,Im both with and against this .
3205,74a4a89593fc,We have a right to privacy unless there is a reason for worry.
3206,95f05cf032cf,This could possibly assist students who have a undetected disorder or possibly prevent school shootings .
3207,95f05cf032cf,"We should have a personal right not to reveal are emotions if we do not want to , but i think if there is a cause for worry on certain students than maybe we could try it."
3208,72b1e0ce53bf,"Every Summer, as school is nearing an end, the other students and I are ecstatic to have some of our future teachers come into our classes and tell us about what we have to look forward too after the break ends, as well as finding out what lesson we will cover, fun projects, and the supplies we should for the class."
3209,72b1e0ce53bf,"What does not please any student however, is when they find out that they have to finish a lengthy assignment before their summer ""break"" is over."
3210,72b1e0ce53bf,"Created by teachers who have no idea of your level of learning, nor who you are, students will inevitably feel overwhelmed"
3211,2a5e929f855d,"The students taking the classes themselves should created the assignment,as even though the teachers may make the plans for the class,"
3212,ba5198dd1510,these students understand where the new students are coming from
3213,91d28d15bf40,as well as the challenges faced inside the class.
3214,d47f86bf21bd,"Although teachers try to fill their summer assignments with care, they fail to understand what the students they are getting actually know."
3215,d47f86bf21bd,"Just because the students should have learned everything from the previous year, most of the time other factors would come into play."
3216,d47f86bf21bd,"Some material was overlooked due to time constraints, while some material was discarded in the depths of the students mind as they felt like they would need it."
3217,d47f86bf21bd,"Nothing felt worse than having a lecture by a ne teacher a material we should have learned the year before, but no one at all could remember it."
3218,d47f86bf21bd,"Having the upperclassmen, who were inside similar shoes to the newer students, make the assignment, they would reinforce what the students will have to know walking into the class day one."
3219,d47f86bf21bd,Upperclassmen would also be able to address through the assignment what material they never learned that the students would need for the beginning of the school year.
3220,d47f86bf21bd,"Even though the teacher should plan for the students to not have learned all the information from previous years, the upperclassmen, through experiencing the class would be better able to give specifics on what future students need to know before school"
3221,bd04a7d94e6d,"Even though the teacher makes the lesson plans for the year, the previous students remember what is actually important for the class."
3222,74a8f8293e4a,"Many times before, upperclassmen have been able to help me through classes by giving me advice on what material was important for the final tests of the year, ranging from simply names of people we have studied about, to entire units that made up big portions of the test."
3223,74a8f8293e4a,"Some times the teacher might skip entire portions of the class, causing the students to miss out on very critical information."
3224,74a8f8293e4a,Having students create summer assignments allows them to fill students on what they have to know for the year.
3225,74a8f8293e4a,"Instead of being surprised by content they would have never known about, the summer assignment would serve as a guide for the year, preparing new students for what to come."
3226,71e3523e420e,"Some may argue that it is the teacher job to prepare the students, and create summer assignments to reflect the year,"
3227,b288c6e16a3f,but the students who took the class ultimately know what the students will need to pass the final tests.
3228,bbaf47f994b2,"By understanding and experiencing the challenges the class faced before and during the school year, The upperclassmen would be able to create a better summer assignment for the new students."
3229,bbaf47f994b2,"throughout school, not only have i sought out upperclassmen, but underclassmen have came to me asking for advice on classes or help studying."
3230,bbaf47f994b2,"Students for a bond with one another, despite the grade level, in order to survive in the educational ecosystem."
3231,bbaf47f994b2,"Unlike teachers, students know what they need in order to succeed as well as regrets and mistakes they will urge the underclassmen not to do."
3232,bbaf47f994b2,What else would be better in helping new students for the year than a guided assinment created one of their own?
3233,69a401aa01f2,Summer projects are something that some schools require students to complete.
3234,69a401aa01f2,"They are given so students may continue to learn, even during their summer break."
3235,69a401aa01f2,"However, there is a debate whether summer projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed."
3236,b2acdba71943,"While some may argue that a teacher-designed project would give some guidance for the students, others believe that a summer project designed entirely by students would allow students to let them be more creative,"
3237,54d7a0e3d94a,students can choose a topic they like
3238,7dfc0ff8979f,students can solve a problem they relate to
3239,5514b69bf5f9,Summer projects should be entirely student-designed to give students a better learning experience during their break.
3240,0c192f8d68bb,"
First, students can choose a topic that they are interested in for their student project."
3241,0c192f8d68bb,"For example, if a student likes video games, then they would be more motivated to do their project than a summer project with the topic of gardening."
3242,0c192f8d68bb,"The students will be more motivated doing something they like, simply because they enjoy it."
3243,0c192f8d68bb,No one wants to do a project that no one likes.
3244,0c192f8d68bb,"In addition to that, students may also be more knowledgable in their topic if they are able to design their project."
3245,0c192f8d68bb,A student could know nothing about gardening and complete a poor project.
3246,0c192f8d68bb,"However, if a student knows everything about video games, then that student can create a very excellent project, because its a topic they like"
3247,aa24bf0cbd95,"Student-designed projects allows students to do what they want to do, and have control over it."
3248,ee6dcc4e169d,"Next, with a student-designed project, students can have more freedom in what they want to do."
3249,5b2e8d4f6410,Some students may not like what topic the teacher gives for a project.
3250,5b2e8d4f6410,This can decrease the motivation for some students to do it.
3251,5b2e8d4f6410,"However, with a student-designed project, students can be more creative with their project, because people like to learn what they are interested in."
3252,5b2e8d4f6410,"Freedom will also make students more motivated to complete their projects, because they are free to do anything.. Freedom can also allow students to be critical thinkers."
3253,5b2e8d4f6410,"Some students are the ""go by the book"" students."
3254,5b2e8d4f6410,This means they always follow what they are supposed to do and not think outside the box.
3255,5b2e8d4f6410,Student-designed projects allow students to think differently and not just use what they have always learned in school.
3256,5b2e8d4f6410,Freedom is key for summer projects.
3257,c934495ff3b6,"Lastly, students can choose a problem that students relate to."
3258,1e7a05d11d4f,"If a projects asks for the solution to a problem, then students can choose a problem that affects them."
3259,1e7a05d11d4f,This would allow students to have a better understanding of the problem and how to solve the problem.
3260,1e7a05d11d4f,"It would make students more motivated to try to create a solution, because of how the problem affects them."
3261,1e7a05d11d4f,"For example, if a student chooses a topic about global warming, most students know about the dangers associated with global warming, which gives that student a better understanding of the topic."
3262,1e7a05d11d4f,"In addition to that, the student would be more motivated in doing their project, because global warming affects that student and everybody else on Earth."
3263,1e7a05d11d4f,Having a problem that students can relate to for a summer project would increase motivation and knowledge of the topic.
3264,05442a332de2,Students should be able to design their summer projects to give students a better learning experience.
3265,05442a332de2,"The freedom to do anything, the ability to choose a topic, and solving a relatable problem are all associated with student-designed projects."
3266,05442a332de2,Student projects will allow students to do whatever they want to do and be motivated.
3267,05442a332de2,"Motivation is the key idea for student-designed projects, because motivation is what drives students to succeed."
3268,05442a332de2,"After school is over, there will be no teacher-designed projects, and for good reason too."
3269,05442a332de2,Students will have to do things on their own without someone telling them to in life.
3270,05442a332de2,Student-designed projects are the key to a good education for all students during their summer break.
3271,b3e1a31fef17,Some schools are requiring students to do a summer projects to assure that they are learning during their break.
3272,b3e1a31fef17,Do you think that this project should be designed by the teachers or students?
3273,471997bc8b9c,Teachers should design the project
3274,fcb60dbf0a28,they know what their students struggle on and could include some tips.
3275,4478b22ff239,"Teachers are with their students the whole year so their most likely to know what each student struggles on, it may not be the whole class that struggles on one topic but the point of the project is to go over certain topics so you won't forget them."
3276,4478b22ff239,The main reason students take test are to see what they struggle on or lack knowledge in and with the teacher designing the project it will focus mainly on those topics.
3277,4478b22ff239,If the students were to design the project they could focus to much on one topic or may not include the most needed topic at all.
3278,4478b22ff239,"For example, if it were a math project the student could struggle with their multiplication tables but have more knowledge on everything else, the student could forget to include the multiplication tables or they could just focus lightly on the topic they really need."
3279,4478b22ff239,Teachers could include a guide or some helpful tips to make sure that everything that is to be known about that concept will be there.
3280,4478b22ff239,"Students could have payed attention to the topic but still couldn't comprehend it, the teacher could know some tips and tricks to help make it easier for a struggling student."
3281,4478b22ff239,Including helpful tips could also make it easier for the students who have learning disabilities.
3282,e2cf1d1d9bd1,Students that struggle with a concept could teach themselves the wrong thing.
3283,e2cf1d1d9bd1,"A student that is struggling with a concept will probably use the internet to try to learn more about it, certain websites can teach the student the wrong thing or probably won't teach them at all."
3284,c58cd5f3642f,Teachers will use their knowledge and what they've learned to teach the student the correct way or how they're supposed to learn it
3285,b727f6c65741,Teachers can tell the students how to format the project in ways they won't forget it.
3286,b727f6c65741,Students might just write down the topics and not the way to do it or they could even just write down a problem about the topic and later on forget how to do it.
3287,b727f6c65741,Teachers can give the students a certain amount of problems so they won't forget or if it is a written or typed project it could tell the students how many sentences they will need.
3288,b727f6c65741,"For instance, if it is a writing project it will tell the students how many spaces they will need, when they should indent their sentences or how they should use certain words."
3289,b727f6c65741,"Telling the students how to format the project could even keep the paper neat, if the students were to write all of the topics together they could later be confused on which topic is which."
3290,b727f6c65741,It could even help you focus on the topics you struggle with the most.
3291,b727f6c65741,If the project was being graded formatting could make it easier to point the teachers in the direction of certain topics.
3292,2b308b71185e,Teachers informing the students on how to format could really save time and keep things neat.
3293,15b0ce06d814,I believe teachers should design the summer projects for the students.
3294,15b0ce06d814,"Letting the teachers designed the projects will make it easier for students who don't understand, students with learning disabilities and it will make it easier for teachers and others to understand."
3295,2ef5c72a4563,According to the article there are new ways to find out how a person is feeling such ass computers.
3296,4a10964fb312,Computers can tell how someone is feeling according to the article ''some new computers software that can recognize emotions''.
3297,34eb70660da1,You might ask how can a computer tell how we feel.
3298,34eb70660da1,They can tell how we are feeling because of our face expression with our face expressions they know if we are feeling good or bad.
3299,34eb70660da1,Humans can tell how a friend or family member is feeling aswell by the same way computers can tell by our face expressions if your head is down or your face just doesnt look like youy wanna talk that mcould mean that your really not happy or when your face is heald high and you want to talk to everyone that can mean your really happy it all depends on your face expressions.
3300,bc6b5d48536e,The mona lisa demonstration is one of the paintings that showes how someone felt
3301,2e6eda3e488e,Accordig to the facial feedback ''theory of emotion movig your facial muscles not only expresses emotions but also may even help produce them''.
3302,a1fb3b6d0434,Students should have the technology to see how they feel
3303,ea40228ed731,because they would actually understand the emotions people are going through
3304,618ff82b5d05,putting a happy face sometimes is not your real happy face it could just be a fake smile.
3305,618ff82b5d05,you can see how fake your smile can be by looking in the mirror and doing these three things.
3306,618ff82b5d05,1.
3307,618ff82b5d05,Raise your lips at the corners of your mouth 2.
3308,618ff82b5d05,Then squint your eyes slightly to produce wrinkling at the corners of your eyes.
3309,618ff82b5d05,3.
3310,618ff82b5d05,"Holding that,raise the outer parts of your vheecks up toward your eyes."
3311,a4eb6be943b8,Dr. Huang even knew individuals showed degrees of exprssions
3312,c4c0839c4ee6,he used video imagaery to track the new facal movements on a real face.
3313,c4c0839c4ee6,this software tracks all the facial movments and mixed emotions every face they get is compared to a neutral face.
3314,c4c0839c4ee6,Dr. Huang is a colleage expert at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate.
3315,670c84ef8bcb,Imagine being able to communicate with a computer and being ablle too see how you feel.
3316,670c84ef8bcb,thats why now technology is getting better for us to interact with them and be able to communicate.
3317,8439cd59ceb5,Its not a good to thing to come up with some new technologie
3318,564f1debcc4f,because you probabaly dont know what people been through
3319,063c0f5cd913,You dont no if sonmbody family remember passed or it could be anything
3320,f3a30b8b1fca,i wouldnt want no new technologie about my feelings.
3321,fa5b08550291,My evidence i got out the article is imagine being able to detect exactly how other person feeling i got that out the article to help me withmy answer.
3322,fa5b08550291,Thats how i found out my answer cause i got it out the article.
3323,fa5b08550291,The main point of me saying my opion is because how the lady looking in this picture it look like she dont look to happy or less she just making up fake smile to hide her pain.
3324,fa5b08550291,In article two it says could you calculate your emotions like math my opion of that is no but in the way it seems like people could calculate your emotions like math.
3325,7034f13ca25d,The way the Author was telling us throughout the story was fasanating
3326,cf7791face36,he let you know everything the hwole way.
3327,cf7791face36,he studied about the pmanet Venus to let us all know about it and understand it better so we arent as worried to think aliens are on that planet but if they knew that no life forms live on that planet and people get a relief.
3328,cf7791face36,They steady study about the the way Venus is what if thier is a living form okn the planet but just is hiding like no one would ever know but they are still trying to find things out and thier are things we do know about but are going to find out alot more about.
3329,cf7791face36,They are trying to improve thier computers the way they do thinhgs just to get to where they need to be to be able to research what they want to research but we just have to eaiot and see wjat other things we have to go through and face with the earth we have right now is getting worse and worse people try and justify others when in order to judge someone you have to of went what they have went through and its hard but we try and move as a team to get to where we should be going.
3330,cf7791face36,The better we get technology wise the farther we can look and just do things it would be amazing and just progress and everybodyu would be good.
3331,666927b75174,"Some people don't believe in alien lifeforms on other planets; they would say, other planets can't support life there due to multiple things: no oxygen, water, food, etc."
3332,666927b75174,"We scientist respond to this with, ""We have all those things here, there has to be some other planet like us."""
3333,6d523181a89e,"Humans need food, water, and air to live, but that doesn't mean that aliens do."
3334,6d523181a89e,They could be like plants and create their own food inside their bodies.
3335,6d523181a89e,"As for water, NASA has discovered that there used to be water on the moon, so what is there to believe there couldn't be any water anywhere else."
3336,6d523181a89e,"People can be very religious and about the Bible and God, but other people can be all about evolution and not creation."
3337,6d523181a89e,"If humans evolved from animals, then we might not be the only ones."
3338,6d523181a89e,"Which means that if humans can evolve into humans, then other organisms can evolve, also."
3339,0dde1b3a5724,"The Face on Mars might be a butte or mesa, but that doesn't mean other organisms don't live outside of the Solar System."
3340,d625ab84854e,"We can't leave here, so we won't ever be able to know."
3341,d625ab84854e,"Life beyond Earth may be just a myth, but it also may be something truly amazing."
3342,2042d90b4f18,I do not believe we should use this on any students
3343,43451318d046,"because for the fact it reads all of our emotions, which we don't always like to show now."
3344,ad4bff476cb2,"""The process begins when the computer costructs a 3-D computer model of the face,"" to me that just sounds like something may go wrong for the fact we have the same kind of camrea for the Iphone and people have trouble with that."
3345,97d83a36bce6,"Another problem for his idea is, ""That facial expressions for each emotion are universal,"" I really don't know about the meaning of this but it doesn't sound good to me either."
3346,07231fe89fa4,lastly I would want them in schools because then I believe it will make schools have more bullies if someone had one and they used it.
3347,bd13aab9e8e8,"Plus they say that technology is going to take over the world, this just might be another reason for this to may be happen."
3348,bf9f955905a0,This technology would be useful in many ways.
3349,bf9f955905a0,"This technology could be very valuable, but it also could be too much for us to handle."
3350,c693172d4252,With technology like this it might make learning things online more interesting.
3351,74e41f8310ef,"Imagine reading a boring documentory about a hero you are writing about for class, as you continue to read the article, a suggested website pops up with interesting facts about your person with more information."
3352,74e41f8310ef,Now you are more interested and the computer has done its job to change your feelings on this presentation.
3353,8a81399b3c38,We could use this technology to do many other similar things like that.
3354,66ab5db3b855,Maybe one day you are just down in the dumps and all these videos you are watching are just making you feel worse and even more bored than before.
3355,66ab5db3b855,Then a suggested video pops up and you are able to watch it and laugh and it was able to take your horrible day and turn it into just another good day.
3356,66ab5db3b855,These are the nice things this kind of technology can do for us.
3357,b069ca26e0f4,Although you might think it is strange to have a computer know exactly how you are feeling when you sit down at in front of it.
3358,6507fcd8909f,There would never be a dull moment in front of the computer though.
3359,5119c806cd1d,Maybe you are just sitting around and you get bored and have nothing better to do so you get up and you make your way to the computer and play with the emotion detector just by making faces at your computer seeing if it can guess how you are feeling.
3360,0070a6ae29a1,"Technology is advancing quick, it is nothing like it used to be, but either you have to run with it or get ran over."
3361,dee1ab02135c,Things are changing fast we have to change with them.
3362,dee1ab02135c,"This is why this technology is so valuable, we can use it in many ways even if its not important."
3363,dee1ab02135c,"We can still get use out of it, so why not make it a thing?"
3364,dee1ab02135c,"In the article it says ""She is 83 percent happy, 9 percent digusted, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry"" talking about the Mona Lisa painting."
3365,dee1ab02135c,Now you cant tell me that that is not cool at all.
3366,e5720749615d,Its pretty amazing what they can do with technology these days so we might as well adjust to it instead of push it away.
3367,e5720749615d,That is why we should be able to have technology like this.
3368,0a96138f4f29,The technology to read a emotional expression is not valuable
3369,be97fc852be3,Because computer are wrong everyday they are the smarts thing on earth but they still get stuff wrong once in a while .
3370,be97fc852be3,They don't know the true feeling of happy and sad .
3371,be97fc852be3,They just computers .
3372,f8c08b6801c0,There millions of reason why it not valuable well for one a person could be looking happy in the picture but be reallly sad emotional
3373,316301555341,"I see it everyday at in the world .Like for explain when someone die and they go to a furel you got to look cool or happy ,but on the inside your heart broken and never be the same ."
3374,316301555341,And you take a picture on a computer and it would say you are happen but you really not because computer don't know emontional they just know knowledge .
3375,989473b7d054,I mean don't get me wrong it a good tool it see people emotional .
3376,b9b694c544d4,"But that why we got eyes for , to look and see things"
3377,dbaad1484cd9,We dont need computer to see people emotional we can tell by the way a person talk
3378,3f476073b839,If that person sound like he or she got a additon (come back) that mean that person is in a bad mood and don't want to talk at that time .
3379,3f476073b839,A computer wouldn't even know he or she in a good mood or not by the way they talk.
3380,3f476073b839,Another good reason why it's not valuable.
3381,53b0292dbb29,Does computer even have emotional?
3382,53b0292dbb29,I don't think so but they can't tell people emotinal .
3383,3338b4002ba3,Compuer don't know what true happence or sadness mean they just tell us whatever they programer put inside them.
3384,3338b4002ba3,True happness is something you don't feel its just there .
3385,3338b4002ba3,Sadness is somthing thats doesn't feel good something that hurts on the inside.
3386,83c4a1988d91,So yea computer really can't read people expressions just from the face .
3387,83c4a1988d91,If it so great im looking in the computer now can you tell me my expression they probably say im sad but im not m just worry .
3388,83c4a1988d91,to pass his test so yea computer are not valuable to expression for people emotional
3389,1173a0b79d58,"Th author did not do a very good job supporting his idea that we should explore Venus, despite the risks."
3390,514a3e33a1a6,"In this article, the author did not give reason why we should explore Venus."
3391,514a3e33a1a6,He just gave facts about Venus and its dangerous conditions.
3392,996d82d761fd,"The author only explained the risk involved in exploring Venus, and not why we should, despite the risk."
3393,996d82d761fd,An example of a random fact that does not back up the authors suggestion: Spacecrafts that land on Venus never come back and only last about two to three hours.
3394,821b9e09ac7d,"At the end of the artcle, the author finally mentions his viewpoint on the subject."
3395,821b9e09ac7d,"But during the actual article, it is not once mentioned that we should go to Venus."
3396,7ea8b37246a8,"In conclusion, the author does not support his suggestion that we should explore Venus but instead lists off random facts he knows about Venus and what we would do if we get there."
3397,c375d52dbad5,"In my ophion, technology reading students emotional expressions is the dumbest thing ever"
3398,9c32425cbeb4,"First, the apps they are using just changes the student indivaully like you can not make someone be happy on a computer you can make them look happy they should not change someone for who they want them to be vs what they are."
3399,9c32425cbeb4,"Second, you should not change a photo or use any edits because thats changing you and you should just be you if you dont smile thats okay dont let people judge you on how you look you should impress your self not somebody eles."
3400,9c32425cbeb4,"Third, People today need to realize that changing someone in any type of way could hurt them even worse."
3401,9c32425cbeb4,"Yes, messing with peoples emotion or sometimes trying to figure it out whats wrong with them can set off alot of things."
3402,2008539c54a7,"Instead of making someone look happy people should talk to the person that is upset, trying to be there for them maybe thats all they need or tell them soemthing postive to brighten there day."
3403,af41513a7ef5,"In Conclusion, I think changing someones pictures to make them look like they are happy is the wose idea ever because deep down they know they are, but do you just because someone makes and upset face dosnt always mean they are."
3404,fa220301ca4c,Have you ever wondered what people are feeling?
3405,fa220301ca4c,well now you can.

3409,fa220301ca4c,"It can tell you six diffrerent emotions, happiness, anger, fear, sadness, surprised, and disgust."
3410,13dd8c3506ea,Dr. Huang's invention is very interesting
3411,2b20da8d65b1,one day I would love to use this meachine.
3412,2b20da8d65b1,its just so diffrenet from looking at your friend and seeing what you think their feeling that actually feeling what they are feeling.
3413,2b20da8d65b1,In this article they were testing da Vinci and they named a code for it.
3414,2b20da8d65b1,"it is called ""da Vinci code."""
3415,9118cce89d3c,It's so crazy to think that a computer can tell if your sad or happy
3416,374a49d5140f,if you did a lab on if your partner can tell if your happy or sad.
3417,374a49d5140f,"the comouter can tell if your faking a smile and if your really smiling, but in a humans eye it hard to see sometimes."
3418,374a49d5140f,people say that your faking a smile until your cheek bones move and tightin up.
3419,b259f85bbaf4,They should do one in a classroom to see if the kids are bored and what time they get bored and intertainded.
3420,9fd53b58b61f,I wonder what peoples thoughts about seeing things online and see what their emotions are when their looking at stuff online.
3421,9fd53b58b61f,or like if you can read someones face when their walking into a interview and what they may be feeling.
3422,973af481bdcd,Whoever can revel so much of this tecnology could maybe make more things in the future and maybe make more products of the face reader and study peoples faces and show what they could be thinking somedays.
3423,d435013cb3cb,i think this idea is pretty cool
3424,838d97455b89,"Dr. Paul Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness,surprise,anger,disgust ,fear and sadness."
3425,838d97455b89,they are controlled by facial muscles above your eyes.
3426,838d97455b89,People can tell when u are fake smiling or making a fake facial exspression.
3427,838d97455b89,There is a new technology called the facial Action coding system enables computers to identify humans emotions.
3428,838d97455b89,They also exsplain how people can tell what your emotion is by your facial exspressions.
3429,838d97455b89,They can tell if you are happy or sad just by looking at you also when u fake smile specialist can tell because it streches your mouth sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle.
3430,838d97455b89,A muscle called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraesus makes crow's feet around your eyes which is also a sign that u have a fake smile.
3431,838d97455b89,"They also explain the steps you can do to show what they are talking about with having ""crows feet"" when you are fake smiling."
3432,838d97455b89,"moving your facial muscles not only exspressses emotion, but also helps produce them and putting on a happy face eventaully works."
3433,838d97455b89,some actors have to use these emotions and facial expressions when they are on stage.
3434,75878ac351bd,its crazy how making faces could show so much about emotions.

3464,a9a90d0724e6,you can't get close to venus because it's too dangerus.
3465,c9d1549e884c,Some of the ways that venus is too dangerus to go to is because we know what will happy if we go.
3466,8a8b66aaf35a,"We sent things up befor and each previous mission was unmanned but for good reason, since not one spacecraft survied the landing for more then maybe a few hours."
3467,8a8b66aaf35a,Thats when we saw the issue and stoped sending up sacescrafts.
3468,8a8b66aaf35a,Not one spaceship has touched down on venus in more that three decades.

3512,fc9d64b273f9,That's another way to help.

3526,dcf57fb88091,"I agree, all students should do Extracurricular Activity in school and outside of school"
3527,6b35ad4a6165,I feel like it will help them out with a lot of stuff like stress and can help them find out who they really are

3531,69593bd3ae41,This program can also help kids not be on their phones as much.
3532,69593bd3ae41,it would help kids come all together and work as a team.
3533,69593bd3ae41,I feel like now in days kids dont really care about there Schools Extracurricular Activity's.
3534,69593bd3ae41,"I feel like a lot of kids\teens depend on this phones for answers, ideas, and etc."
3535,69593bd3ae41,"these ideas will show them that there are better stuff then just being on your Phone, iPad, and Computer."
3536,2dd0c99ccf6b,Student's most of the time dont like school so these Activity's can show them that school can be fun.

3550,a27ac1eed5fd,"I disagree, I feel that the Mona Lisa wasnt really expressing 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry,"
3551,b46f2f4602d6,"she looked like she was just posing for a picture or to be drawn, you cannot just look at somebody and tell what kind of emotions their expiriencing even if you do studies, it could just be thats how she is as a person all the time."
3552,b46f2f4602d6,"The author uses facial feedback theory of emotion, saying not only does moving your facial muscles just express emotions , it may also even help produce them."
3553,b46f2f4602d6,"They say that faces dont lie but anyone can fake emotions she was just taking a photo or was posing to be drawn they could have just made a conclusion stating she was 100 percent happy, I mean she was being drawn which means she must have been one of the best looking women around or something was good about her and only her, and her face drawing is now one of the most known pieces of art ever created."
3554,b46f2f4602d6,In the drawing it looks like shes outside so it could be the lighting or something around her that is causing her face to look like that.
3555,b46f2f4602d6,"Its also hard to tell what kind of emotions shes having because she doesnt have eyebrows, the reason I say that is because most people raise or lower their eyebrows when they are trying to make their emotions noticable, so the main thing people can see about her emotions are her lips they look happy but its like a half smile, but the writer claims she is 83 percent happy, it seems much less than that."
3556,b46f2f4602d6,"Her eyes look like she is staring at someone, not dissapointed."

3560,8ac00bda9621,He says things that we dont have to know but is nice to know.
3561,404eeecca7c7,like in paragraph 2 he says venus is referred as the earth twin and is the closest planet to earth in term of density and size.
3562,39f847633ebb,In paragraphs 4-6 he starts to explain why people should study venus and explain how venus is worthy to pursuit.
3563,1a9e6885bb0f,"In paragraph 4 he says that ""astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most Earth like planet in our solar sytem."""
3564,1a9e6885bb0f,Thats him explaining why venus is worthy of studing and has earth like features.
3565,d31bd18fcab0,In paragraph 5 he beins to talk about NASA and them sending humans to study venus.
3566,56ae9d781f7b,"The author says that ""NASA's possible solution to the hostile condition on the surface of venus would allow scientist to float above the fray."""
3567,56ae9d781f7b,He is now explaining how they can make it suitable for people to go study venus.
3568,0f01a154764a,The author wraps up the story talking about human curiosity and earth should not be limited by dangers and doubts.
3569,0f01a154764a,The author supports the idea that studing venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents really good he gave facts and backed up his idea about studying venus.
3570,a1d2f0d4d923,"After going to school for ten months, students need a bit of a break before starting up again."
3571,a1d2f0d4d923,"Not only are their bodies tired, but so are their minds."
3572,a1d2f0d4d923,Their minds are basically at capacity!
3573,a1d2f0d4d923,"So when summer break rolls around, students tend to leave everything they learned behind."
3574,a1d2f0d4d923,"While understandable to want to stop putting more information in their brain, students should never leave what they know behind."
3575,a1d2f0d4d923,"Students work so hard for a long time, to gain new information and more knowledge."
3576,a1d2f0d4d923,"In order to assure continued learning, teachers assign summer projects."
3577,a1d2f0d4d923,"Unfortunately, students decide to not do the assigned summer projects because it tends to get in the way of their summer."
3578,a1d2f0d4d923,"So, what if the switch was flipped and students could create their own summer projects?"
3579,faa2ac2d2870,Students should have the freedom to complete their own summer assignments
3580,7339a8ea9a58,they're more likely to do the project when it's their own
3581,5abb421074bf,"students can express their own creativity,"
3582,9d40d950d81c,they will actually enjoy doing their project.
3583,27a45d281b62,"If students could create their own assignments, they would actually do the work to get it done."
3584,31c29494a619,"They have all summer to come up with a fun project idea, so why not make it the greatest one possible?"
3585,31c29494a619,"Fast-forwarding to when school starts up again, students will have a completed project to present to their teachers and peers."
3586,31c29494a619,"They won't only be happy for the grade, but they'll be proud of themselves for completing their project."
3587,d982d40e8fb6,"Adding to the positive, teachers will have a better impression of what their students do."
3588,d982d40e8fb6,"Meaning that teachers will know how to operate their classes, based on their students and how they learn."
3589,c14d8be070f4,Students will also be able to express their creativity freely.
3590,12f34e2d9879,"For example, one student may not be able to color, paint, or draw, while another student is really good at coloring, painting, and drawing."
3591,12f34e2d9879,"The student who isn't as good at doing those things, may be better at using computers to create things."
3592,12f34e2d9879,"So that student should be able to complete his/her summer assignment, on his/her terms."
3593,12f34e2d9879,"Some teachers assume that all students are capable of doing only one thing, which is very untrue and unrealistic."
3594,12f34e2d9879,"Students should not be limited to doing one thing, in one way."
3595,12f34e2d9879,"It's unfair that some teachers grade based on how artistic the assignment is, or how technological it is."
3596,12f34e2d9879,Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.
3597,12f34e2d9879,"Teachers should look towards all their students specific strengths, instead of aiming at their weaknesses."
3598,12f34e2d9879,"Plus, teachers should be very fond of students' creativity in their assignments, and grade them based on the student's hard work, the assignment criteria, and their creativity."
3599,0cbdb43a4c9d,"Lastly, students will actually enjoy working on their summer projects!"
3600,e07bd486eb4b,"Since they have their own freedom to create whatever the please, they can make it any way they want."
3601,e07bd486eb4b,"On top of that, they'll have the whole summer to make their very own masterpiece."
3602,e07bd486eb4b,"So, when working on the assignment, it won't seem like such a drag to have to complete."
3603,e07bd486eb4b,Students can also work at their own pace.
3604,e07bd486eb4b,"Since students do have a solid three months to complete and revise their projects, there should be nothing less than perfection."
3605,29233d9c7cb9,"All in all, students should never stop learning new things."
3606,29233d9c7cb9,The new way of learning is expressed through creativity.
3607,29233d9c7cb9,"Scott Fitzgerald once said,

""For what it's worth... it's never too late, or too early, to be whoever you want to be."
3608,29233d9c7cb9,"There's no limit

""."
3609,29233d9c7cb9,"Students should not be limited to creativity, creativity should be unlimited to students."
3610,29233d9c7cb9,"Students should create their own summer assignments, to assure the continuation of learning, and to show them there will never be a limit to their own creativity."
3611,4f7414d81fc9,Have you ever wondered what other planets are like?
3612,4f7414d81fc9,Have you ever gotten the questioned yourself about these other planets like... Have scientists found other lifeforms?
3613,4f7414d81fc9,Have scientists found resorces on other planets like they have on Earth?
3614,4f7414d81fc9,well then if thats the case let me explain you why
3615,f69fb7ddde14,"""Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."""
3616,0047ec8f5596,There could possibily be other life forms on other planets and even Venus
3617,8b7ba7dfb688,"how there's life forms on Earth, typicaily Humans, Animals and even Bacteria like Algy and Fungi, In the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" In paragraph 4 it says ""Venus could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"
3618,19b2f92a092e,"Another reason why Venus is worth studying is, like the Sun its the hottest thing in our solar system"
3619,c67c1af1ec6e,"what if Venus is not as hot as the Sun but what if Venus is hot for anything to be on there, in the article "" The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" In paragraph 3 it says ""Venus tempreture average is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit."""
3620,6e38cc5ef13f,what if it relates to Earth in many ways?
3621,4e8db7f23218,"In the article in paragraph 4 it says ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans"""
3622,e67df760f1b4,"This is all the evidence on why Venus is worth discovering dispite the dangers while, Scientists may have discovered a bit of Venus and a bit of Mars unfortionatly for now some of those planets remain a mystery while some are on the very peak of changing from the unknown to the discoverable."
3623,92adc55a313b,"That ""Facial Action Coding System"" is a Joke"
3624,193cdf5002c5,We all know that there are different emotions going are the school.
3625,193cdf5002c5,"The different types of emotions that are commonly at a school are happy, mad, sad, bored, or even nuetral."
3626,99c55d9f708c,"My question is, why do you care how the student is feeling?"
3627,93ce4ec2f756,"I know that the teacher himself or herself does not want to be here so, what makes them think that us students wants to be here."
3628,62501e1891ec,"A student comes in the school the teacher says, ""Goodmorning!"""
3629,62501e1891ec,The student just walks past without saying anything.
3630,62501e1891ec,"Let me take a guess, the student is not feeling school, sleepy, or even that student might not like the teacher."
3631,7158f412f737,"We do not need a ""Facial Action Coding System"" pulled out to just find out the students feeling."

3636,94d7b0867c54,Lukes particapation to the Seagoing Cowboys progam allowed him to experience adventures.
3637,921d42973dfa,The one thing it didn't mention in the artical was his family where were they the whole time Luke was on board.
3638,921d42973dfa,The artical never mentioned a mom or dad.
3639,921d42973dfa,Was Luke alone with no communication skills.
3640,c398565137e2,I think you shouldn't join the Seagoing Cowboys
3641,607d11d29e81,you wouldn't get to see your family for as long as your with the Cowboys.
3642,3bda22becd52,"Yes, it's an adventure"
3643,7d4b387bb37c,but you could get sea sick or worse home sick.
3644,7d4b387bb37c,If you get home sick you may not know what to do.
3645,cc2990401c19,"You wouldn't want to go out in the sea, unboard animals then go back to main land."
3646,ad4d8e9bdc56,No one wants to do that.
3647,ad4d8e9bdc56,To many people would get sick and not want to go back on board and that would just put more pressure on you to do more work.
3648,ad4d8e9bdc56,"You won't know if you have a certain amount of time to do certain things on the boat, who knows."
3649,1232c48fdcac,"Luke may have loved all the adventures and great times, but that's only one person's point of view of the whole idea."
3650,a4da96e5d693,You would need more oppinions in order to see if it is a good service to work for.
3651,a4da96e5d693,Everybody may say joining the Cowboys is an amazing idea but others may say it's a terrible idea.
3652,a4da96e5d693,"How much money does it cost to join the Cowboys, They never mentioned that either."
3653,d09a38f0653a,Luke's particapation the seagoing Cowboys was amazing in his mind but thats his mind not yours.
3654,d09a38f0653a,Choose wisly on whether you want to join the seagoing Cowboys.
3655,d09a38f0653a,It's your desicion not Luke's or anyone elses.
3656,6a229ba930b4,Some teachers feel that students should complete a summer project during their break to have them continue their studies even during the summer.
3657,1ed1c8e1e4a5,These projects should be student-designed to promote a students own creativity and ability to create a project based on the subject they learned
3658,3c09d0a4f1d1,Allowing individuals to make their own projects means they will have the freedom to design the project how they see fit;
3659,a7cc05b268d0,"furthermore, this may even benefit the teacher by showing that their student has absorbed enough information from the class, that they can detail an entire project about the curriculum without ever receiving any instruction from the teacher."
3660,02935a3bc250,Students perform better when they are able to dictate how their project is written and designed.
3661,02935a3bc250,"if their was a strict code detailing what the project must include, the student may produce a worse report than they would otherwise."
3662,2ce1fc1a66e4,"Given creative freedom, someone would also have to apply more of their own knowledge of the subject."
3663,2ce1fc1a66e4,"Having to adhere to a strict code however, would mean they can simply research the specific topics the teacher asked for without needing to apply much of their own effort"
3664,5bac7cc205b7,"If the enforcer of this project wrote a rigid outline describing exactly what a learner must write about, the report could very plausibly be submitted as a mindless paper with no true interest taken in it."
3665,5bac7cc205b7,"The individual could provide exactly what the teacher asks for, no more, no less."
3666,5bac7cc205b7,One may even be rewarded for this work since they did all that was asked of them.
3667,02f54acb4cc4,"All someone would need to do for a report, if it has strict rules, is follow those rules entirely while putting minimal effort."
3668,02f54acb4cc4,"People could be given a high grade for doing as the report said, even though they turned in a mediocre paper with no real care in the subject matter."
3669,02f54acb4cc4,"There wouldnt be a way of giving this mediocre paper the grade it deserves, because the student did what they were told and they took advantage of that loophole."
3670,02f54acb4cc4,"To avoid this mindless compliance, students should instead be given total and complete freedom on their report as long as they apply everything they've learned throughout the school year."
3671,02f54acb4cc4,"This would be a double edged sword, while they are free to design however they want, they must also put in more effort because they will not get any help or instruction from the teacher."
3672,02f54acb4cc4,"Some may believe that a teacher-designed project is a better alternative because if the teacher has a specific rubric, they can help the student by giving them a code to follow"
3673,1a63233cbf60,"It should be the opposite, They have helped their students all year, now it is time for them to finish one last report by themselves, to prove they can retain this information without any outside help."
3674,1a63233cbf60,"The teacher has finished their job, they have taught the entirety of the curriculum to their learners, and now those learners must utilize all the knowledge given to them in one project, on their own."
3675,3eb61af964f2,This makes them feel that they only have an obligation to simply know certain ideas.
3676,3eb61af964f2,"In turn, this causes them to memorize specific vocabulary words or the answers to certain questions."
3677,3eb61af964f2,"Instead, people should be encouraged to memorize the concepts themselves."
3678,3eb61af964f2,"Take in all the information regarding an idea to truly become knowledgeable in the subject as a whole, as opposed to learning the answer to specific questions so you can pass a test later and forget about it almost immediately after."
3679,3eb61af964f2,This is exactly what this final grade is: a test.
3680,5b82795d25ea,A test with one chief purpose: to display one's complete knowledge and understanding of the class they have partaken in for the past year.
3681,18be9e46b23a,This should not just be something you can memorize a few vocabulary words and write down a couple notes for.
3682,18be9e46b23a,It would prove absolutely nothing if you can simply study for this project and write down what has been memorized.
3683,18be9e46b23a,"To really take on this endeavor, the students will have to include everything they have been taught over their four quarters of experience."
3684,18be9e46b23a,They must be graded on how much they really paid attention and how much effort they put into the class.
3685,e8e80dd56393,"summer projects should be student-designed to allow students more freedom to dictate their project, which may cause some to submit a report worthy of a much higher grade than they might have otherwise received."
3686,e8e80dd56393,"It would also prevent mindless compliance stemming from a feeling that they have an obligation to adhere to a strict set of rules a teacher has laid out for them, leading to an equally as careless report."
3687,e8e80dd56393,"Given creative freedom, A project will be much more personalized and thoughtful, and will require more effort to be put into it."
3688,e8e80dd56393,"This will all prove that the person will be able to properly retain all of this information outside of school, whether it be during summer break, or after they have graduated completely."
3689,e8e80dd56393,"In everyday life, they wont have someone who can immediately tell them all of the answers, A summer break with no external guidance will prepare them for this reality."
3690,1702fc6446d8,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents to humans that even get near the planet."
3691,b2338d0bfaf8,"Even with the dangers that are poised against those who would go near Venus, there is still intrigue in the planet from our simple human nature,"
3692,05c714d6abb3,"the opporatunity of studing an Earth like planet besides our own,"
3693,e59e96f1244f,Venus is so close to Earth.
3694,2016c0862a90,"The main reason of studying the planet Venus is capitalized by the article and the author in this quote ""Often referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."""
3695,658aef571325,The Author also simply puts in the article that humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on Venus all unmanned.
3696,1e036293c125,Another reason for the intrigue in studing Venus is our simple human nature.
3697,13e1d9719192,"In another quote by the author and in the article ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus beceause it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."""
3698,13e1d9719192,the author gives us a reason and it's a reason that makes logical sense.
3699,13e1d9719192,The landscape of Venus is also described in the article as Earth like.
3700,d8363c182aac,The author suggested studying Venus would be a wirthy pursuit despite the dangers.

3702,3221596b1dc5,"Nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving."
3703,3221596b1dc5,1 out of 4 accidents are caused in the united states by texting and driving.
3704,3ad91dde5dab,"Drivers should not be able to operate cell phone use while driving, it causes the driver to get distracted from the road and that could cause the driver to have an accident."
3705,87f12cc48857,"However, some drivers may still respond to a text message and that is why many of the accidents occurs and most of the time this lead to a vehicle accident that could lead to death."
3706,87f12cc48857,Drivers need to understand how easily it is to take someone life or themselves.
3707,87f12cc48857,Everyday people are risking their lives due to the high rate of cell phone use while operating a vehicle.
3708,87f12cc48857,"Therefore, nowadays cell phones are unnecessary devices because they are a distraction to drivers while their on the road."
3709,87f12cc48857,Because of their conversation they might get upset and this could lower their driving ability that can lead them to lose control over the car.
3710,87f12cc48857,If people don't make the right decision and put their cell phone away while driving their routine could harm innocent people.
3711,53154536e665,Some people may feel uncomfortable without their cell phone mainly because they are so use to having their cell phone in hand while driving
3712,a7664da10381,.
3713,a7664da10381,"On the other hand there are disadvantages of using cell phones, they can easily get lost."
3714,a7664da10381,Talking on cell phones are very expensive.
3715,a7664da10381,"In addition, cell phones are not useful while driving, drivers should pay attention to the road instead of getting distracted from a text or phone call."
3716,185fe917eba5,"In conclusion, I think that cell phones are indispensable tools that we cannot live without, but we should avoid using them while operating a vehicle."
3717,185fe917eba5,"Therefore, we should think carefully about the advantages of cell phone use while on the road."
3718,254b4548d5a5,we are all zombies on these devices no one cares they make so many things easier for people to do and enjoy themselves.
3719,254b4548d5a5,"The way society shows us is that we all use phones like idiots and honestly, my opinion doesn't change because I know that many people have used their phones pretty stupidly and lose their life for it"
3720,089a5e11fa9f,use it when not in the motion of driving
3721,a403f3d5c32b,Keep your eyes out for police.
3722,bcee9a587d74,"
Driving is our main way of transportation so we need to keep ourselves safe and everyone else safe"
3723,ebc09b3c81da,the best way to do that is to keep our phones away keeping your phone is smart while driving because texting and driving is a big no-no in everyone else's eyes.
3724,ebc09b3c81da,"The only reason why I think people need to follow this is because I've driven with people who have sat at the light because they were stuck on their phones and I had to tell them to drive so, to be honest, we need to limit ourselves to do it only when are stopped in traffic or we just parked up somewhere."
3725,ad0790626f4e,"I don't drive yet but everyone should just know this rule or just follow it at all times watch for police,"
3726,856c27a77171,"police are like enemies they protect the streets and I respect them for that but honestly, they should always be avoided I'm not saying avoid them at any means necessary but just keep seat belts on and don't text and drive that's the easiest way a cop will catch you so make sure to get wherever you need to go and just move on try not to get in any trouble."
3727,3ec8f41328af,And to conclude phones are really convenient devices that make millions of things easier for us day to day humans
3728,dcd896fd7d1f,we need to limit ourselves to just using it when not driving and only when it is really needed
3729,60197b6894ff,many cars nowadays come with their own little carphone technology that will speak to you and do stuff for you.
3730,60197b6894ff,Apps like Waze make driving feel much safer and cars like teslas and the other cars I spoke about before can be great substitutes for phones while driving.
3731,b84c65d7071b,It could not be made by aliens because Mars can make land forms such as a face or something.
3732,7bec5cec37af,If you look at these three images you will notice over the years we have been able to unblur this image and it shows there is no face on Mars.
3733,3221e743c4a3,"
We have snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos."
3734,3221e743c4a3,"Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site, reaveling. . .a natrual landform."
3735,3221e743c4a3,"As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in the picture like airplanes on the ground of Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks,you could see what they were."
3736,3221e743c4a3,What the picture actual shows is the Matrian equivalent of a butte or mesa- landforms common around the American West.
3737,3221e743c4a3,New high-resolution images and 3D altimentry from NASA's Mars Global Survey spacecraft reveal the Face on Mars for what it really is: A messa.

3739,c7c15d1c81fa,Today my firend Don Reist inviited me to come with him to the Seagoing Cowboys program he wanted me to go and tought about and Want to go mainly becaues I was 18 and out of school and i can get dafted to the army.
3740,c7c15d1c81fa,Don telled me that since the war was over we go to this other country and help them out a little sice it was a big mess over.
3741,c7c15d1c81fa,"It was August 14, they reported us at New Orleans."
3742,c7c15d1c81fa,When we got there they were giving out thing to do before the ship got there they said for me go get more peole to do this program and I did.
3743,c7c15d1c81fa,I walked down to the bordwalk got a big line of people the fun thing was that if you get to convince eveyone who does not want to go then they just go some were real nice and just went but they were probalry going to be dafted like me.
3744,c7c15d1c81fa,"August 15 the cattle boat was not there so, they said do the same thing again the same thing happend got a lot of people then they gave another job that it is to see wich man was strong enough to go they said i got to much people so, we get the strongest of the strongest two hour went bye and when eveyone was at lunch the boat was there ."
3745,c7c15d1c81fa,"August 16, I guess sleeping in a boat is the same thing as sleeping in a bed room but the bed was always moving but I can't lie about spleeping good last night."

3750,d8bc436942f7,I think that its a good idae to send more probes to venus even despite the cost.
3751,d8bc436942f7,i am totally on bourd with this.
3752,2e5fa8b6afa1,The author made some good points and suggestions why we should send more things to venus.
3753,4ca7fe4e9ecf,first scientists are researching a way to last longer to get to venus and land on it
3754,20c5b064f049,because it is the closest planet to us but defining the risks it will take they are doing research.
3755,20c5b064f049,but they are trying to make a man pod for a human to go there and study it first hand.
3756,bc664cd66c38,second scientists are also finding a way to make these probes and pods to withstand venus the planet.
3757,c2d10cfed605,simplified electrons made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of venus's surface.
3758,c2d10cfed605,it has lasted three weeks in simulation.
3759,db4dd698d345,lastly they are also looking into an old technology that has more withstand to that stuff and its called mechanical computors
3760,436d6dfb8fc0,.
3761,436d6dfb8fc0,they were created in the 1900 and was used in world war 2 they had no electronics it was just gears and wires and levers.
3762,436d6dfb8fc0,but they do the job they can withstand a high pressure of heat and other forces.
3763,4576e5100cd6,the author did support his story with facts that if we dont do it now then human curiosity will do it later
3764,547b21b8d351,Some Schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break.
3765,547b21b8d351,"Some may point out that since the students are the ones taking time out of their break to complete these assignments, they should be the ones designing them."
3766,547b21b8d351,Others may argue that the teachers should design these projects.
3767,cb2b1c856eee,Summer projects should be teacher-designed
3768,f370bf99f378,"the teachers will be the ones grading them,"
3769,2dc6ab03bc25,"they will make sure that there is still an element of difficulty,"
3770,bdb894813918,they know the content best.
3771,e1abaa20b039,One reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is that the teachers will be the ones grading these projects.
3772,634c22a4a024,Teachers spend hours or even days grading assignments.
3773,634c22a4a024,"If students designed the projects, it would be harder for teachers to determine what the grading rubric should include."
3774,634c22a4a024,It should be up to them what they will be inevitably grading at the start of the school year.
3775,634c22a4a024,Most teachers have new students every year.
3776,634c22a4a024,"If students designed these projects, they would be different every year."
3777,634c22a4a024,This would lead to mistakes because the teacher would not be as familiar with the assignment.
3778,e674267f3f8f,Another reason why summer assignments should be teacher-designed is that they will make sure the project will still have an element of difficulty to it.
3779,5928eae81230,It is teachers' jobs as educators to continue create and assign projects that are challenging enough for the level that their students are at.
3780,5928eae81230,"If students designed their projects, the projects would not be very difficult."
3781,5928eae81230,This would be because students generally prefer to spend their summers doing other things than homework.
3782,5928eae81230,"If the assignments are not challenging, than the students are more likely to forget about it or not care about it."
3783,5928eae81230,The point of summer assignments is to keep the students engaged and learning throughout the break.
3784,5928eae81230,"Teachers would make sure that the assignment is easy enough so students dont spend their entire summer stressing about it, but challenging enough so that the assignment is still effective."
3785,9987fc7f5ec6,The last reason why summer projects should be teacher-designed is that they know the content best.
3786,e61e7d93e079,The projects assigned are most likely for the class the students plan on taking the following school year.
3787,e61e7d93e079,"For example, if a student is taking algebra 2 and plans to continue on to pre-calculus, the student doesnt know much about calculus yet."
3788,e61e7d93e079,"That being said, how would a student design a project for a class they havent taken yet."
3789,e61e7d93e079,The students are there to learn and it is the teachers job to teach them.
3790,e61e7d93e079,"The students should not, and could not, teach themselves the content required to know for the following year."
3791,e61e7d93e079,The only person who can properly prepare students for a class is the teacher themselves.
3792,cdf7a64c876a,"In conclusion, the summer projects that some schools require students to complete should be teacher-designed."
3793,cdf7a64c876a,"First, Teachers should be able to create what they will be grading."
3794,cdf7a64c876a,"Second, Teachers will also make sure that the projects are not just pointless busy work."
3795,cdf7a64c876a,"And last but not least, It is the teachers job to educate student on unfamiliar subjects."
3796,fa899baa87d2,"Hi, i'm Luke, and one day I was working at the bank and my friend, Don ask ""Hey Luke, you want to go to Europe on a cattle boat with me!"""
3797,fa899baa87d2,How could say no to that type of question?
3798,fa899baa87d2,I'v always want to do this.
3799,fa899baa87d2,"The UNRRA hired ""Seagoing Cowboys"" to take care of all the horses, young cows, mules that were shiped oversea."
3800,fa899baa87d2,Don and I signed up for this adventure!
3801,82f04d6848f0,i'm here to say you should sign up and be the best Seagoing Cowboy you can be.
3802,c23bd92b7f77,You get to help other people and animals.
3803,bdf024c23883,"Before I got here I was a small little town boy, and I really never got to experince the majic hidding behind of being a Seagoing Cowboy."
3804,bdf024c23883,I even got a little of the benefit of seeing Europe and China.
3805,bdf024c23883,I also went to Acropolis in Greece was special.
3806,bdf024c23883,"So was taking a gondola ridein Venice, Italy, a city with streets of water."
3807,bdf024c23883,I also got to see an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.
3808,bdf024c23883,"Also, when I help out other people first, it makes me feel good second off it perpares me for hard work along the way of my life."
3809,bdf024c23883,"I also got to be a night watchman I did get hurt a little but, before the week was over I was back to work, and better than ever."
3810,401d28952956,I came here to try to explain how much I loved this trip.
3811,401d28952956,It prepared me for life.
3812,401d28952956,I hope you will join and become a Seagoing Cowboy.
3813,401d28952956,"The phone number is below

(555) 444-7774"
3814,b117a4c63158,Do you participate in any after school activities?
3815,b117a4c63158,"Well if you don't now you have to, my principal if making it mandatory to participate in at least one after school activity."
3816,b117a4c63158,"You can participate in many activities such as sports teams, student council, and the debate team."
3817,7bb92bed4fc1,There are many points for why this shouldn't be a rule in school.
3818,6c174bbd1d1a,"Some points are time management,"
3819,e18b753a740a,"interest,"
3820,91b5849cdbed,funds/workers.
3821,70414e8a3151,"One of these important things is homework, if there doing activities they don't have time to do the homework a teacher assigned."
3822,70414e8a3151,This would lead the student to be behind in there classwork and cause there grade to drop.
3823,70414e8a3151,The second important thing they wouldn't have time to do is there chores.
3824,70414e8a3151,A lot of kid have chores and if there not done there parents will not be happy.
3825,70414e8a3151,This leading to the kid getting in trouble and getting a punishment.
3826,b64740817cef,if there is no activities that interest the student there not going to have fun.
3827,b64740817cef,And if they are not having fun they will slack off and not try there best.
3828,b64740817cef,If a student doesn't want to do a activity that may cause them to make there own fun and act out and get into trouble.
3829,b64740817cef,Then there parents would be angry and they would get in more trouble and the teachers would be angry because if the kid got Saturday school the teacher have to come watch them.
3830,b64740817cef,Plus if they get in trouble that will mess with there record.
3831,bac54937564a,if you have more activities you need more money and more people to work them.
3832,bac54937564a,And the school would have to ask the county for more money and the county might not have that amount of fund for the school.
3833,bac54937564a,And you have to find the people to work those activities witch may be hard to do.
3834,bac54937564a,And the schools may not be big enough for the activities to all be housed there.
3835,bac54937564a,And that means they might have to rent a space for a activity to be held and that cost more money.
3836,d92c9bd7e233,That is my three points on why I thing it would not be a good idea to make it mandatory for every student to participate in a after school activity.
3837,d92c9bd7e233,I already participate in a after school activity but I hope it is never mandatory.
3838,d92c9bd7e233,It would not achieve what school want witch is to keep kids active.
3839,d92c9bd7e233,It would only make the problem get worse and wouldn't fix it at all.
3840,d92c9bd7e233,"The three points are funds/workers, interest, and time management."
3841,90c9df281113,The new technology called the Facial Action Coding Sytem would't be valuable computers to identity human emotions.
3842,d4ce2b620aa4,"First,Dr Huang and his colleague are experts at developing better ways for human and computers to comunicate."
3843,1531f2f2b9f5,Dr. Huang think that it won't make a differences by the new techonlogy.
3844,1531f2f2b9f5,"Dr. Eckman has classified six basic emotions-happiness,surprise,anger,digust,fear,and sadness-and then associated each charachteristic movements of the facial muscles..Using video imagery,the new emotion recognition software these facial movements in a real face or Mona lisa."
3845,1531f2f2b9f5,If a computer could identity then it should identy all 44 major muscles in the movement like humans.
3846,a2ac9856705f,"Second,""the facial expressions for each emotion are universal,""observes Dr."
3847,a2ac9856705f,Huang.
3848,a2ac9856705f,"""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confued or bored""Dr. Huang predicts."
3849,a2ac9856705f,"""Then it could modify the lesson,like an effective human instructo."
3850,a2ac9856705f,"""""Most human communication is nonverbal,including emotional communicaton,""notes Dr."
3851,a2ac9856705f,Huang.
3852,a2ac9856705f,"""So computers need to understand that,too."""
3853,2c8bf10c4386,"Then,Your home PC can't hanlde the complex algotithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile."
3854,d77ae47988ca,"But we can wrtie down some simple instruction that""encode""different emotion."
3855,d77ae47988ca,"In fact,these are the instructions for a face that looks happy."
3856,d77ae47988ca,It;s all about those muscular action units.
3857,d77ae47988ca,Humans could tell a friend is feeling simply by he look on her or hise face.
3858,d77ae47988ca,"Of course,most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that convy happy,worried."
3859,c52fc3f06df0,"Finally, A classroom of student could identify more then the new technology could do."
3860,9b15d0bafa40,"Sometimes,human might smile from the outside but human could change their feeling."
3861,9b15d0bafa40,A classroom of student could see their friends by thier looks.
3862,373c82f9d980,"Conclusion,The new techgology won't be valuable to read the expressions of students in a classroom because empathy may happen."

3875,63e3fb556bea,Writing a strong and supported essay takes more than just advanced vocabulary and a plethora of facts .
3876,63e3fb556bea,"A strong example of this is the article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"""
3877,c476d0a42141,The author did not support his topic very well
3878,d181711e747d,he didn't support his main idea enough
3879,c04b68659ca4,he strayed away from the topic many times
3880,13eef0f31e3e,his information is an abundance of opinions and assumptions.
3881,ceabf356e972,"
First, the author brings up his topic of "" Studying Venus is a worhty pursuit despite the dangers it presents""."
3882,ceabf356e972,"Despite this, the author only gave one full paragraph, out of the eight he wrote, on why humans would want to explore the planet ; he then preceeded to go onto the dangers of Venus, rather than why it is worth exploring."
3883,7a3fa71c86e1,"Secondly, the author ,many times, rambled on about other points that had nothing to do with his main idea."
3884,1651b2dcf62a,"The author gave an entire paragraph about the new technologies that NASA is working on to explore Venus, even though his main idea is about why we should send shuttles to Venus."
3885,1651b2dcf62a,"In the article it states "" Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers."
3886,1651b2dcf62a,"These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during World War II""."
3887,1651b2dcf62a,"This entire quote has nothing to do with the topic whatsoever, which shows that the author was gettting side tracked."
3888,1651b2dcf62a,"One reading just this quote from the article would most likely think this article is about computers,and not why humans should explore Venus."
3889,9e12b2aff3d2,"Finally, the supporting evidence that the author did bring up, weren't very factual or even well thought out."
3890,98a9104daa6e,"One of the points brought up was ""Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life,just like Earth""."
3891,98a9104daa6e,"The author uses the word ""probably"" which means that he doesn't know this to be a fact or not."
3892,98a9104daa6e,"The author also wrote ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus"" ; this is an opinion, seeing as some astronomers might heavily dislike venus."
3893,98a9104daa6e,"A good informative or arguementative essay provides facts to supports its ideas, rather than just guessing or presuming."
3894,9a6402826380,"The author does not suport his ideas well, because he draws the reader away from the topic many times, he doesn't support his thesis very well, and the evidence he does bring up are opinions or assumptions."
3895,9a6402826380,"The author provides to much on the ""danger"" aspect of it, and he should focus more on the ""why"" aspect of his idea ."

3924,123f529a6ab7,To summarize why studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite of how dangerous it is scientist have found and made devices that could help pick up and look for sediments on Venus due to hot it is when standing on it.
3925,3a70439674a6,Do you believe texting and drive is bad and can cause car accidents or any terrible thing to happen?
3926,3a70439674a6,Honestly doing any like that can lead to no common sense especially when you have someone in the car with you.
3927,3a70439674a6,Over thousands of people die from a car accident situation which unlikely happy for love one's.
3928,3a70439674a6,I feel like more of this comes from young adults and teens because there still in that developing stage where this and that needs to be learned.

3932,40d42782b32e,There are a lot of things you need to realize with driving and texting.
3933,40d42782b32e,First of all if you do it you need to be cautious and smart about it
3934,6b0be3d4aae1,Because one if you need to text someone because it's an emergency do it at a red light or if you need to tell someone important then just stop somewhere .
3935,6b0be3d4aae1,If you don't do none of the sort you can lead to accident or dealing with the cops.
3936,6b0be3d4aae1,"And, you can get in a lot of trouble with dealing with the cops."
3937,6b0be3d4aae1,If you feel like driving and texting is ok then maybe it is to you only if you know what your doing and being safe with those actions.
3938,6b0be3d4aae1,The statistics are very high for teens almost 11 die everyday texting and over 80% of people own cell phones.
3939,4e9ddf38808b,Some people would say is sending that 1 small text important that causing your life or that other person life
3940,8fd3a3c14d26,Is it worth it because bad things happen everyday even if we don't want them too.
3941,8fd3a3c14d26,"Also , you can pull a ride with anyone and if there on the phone and you feel unsafe let them know that but if your scared you risking everything cause you never know what's gonna happen"
3942,e50b84a1fb17,The only thing you can really do is pray for the best to happen and keep living your life.
3943,e50b84a1fb17,I feel like every driver should be at least 17+ driving because at the age i feel like a little more common sense it should know by now what the rules are.
3944,51c7474292b7,texting and driving both don't get along or work out for people at the end of the day
3945,691f4afa049f,Teens are the main people who get distracted because either there texting or playing with there friends in the car which seems to be a very bad idea knowing they are so very young.
3946,691f4afa049f,People always make excuses as soon as an accident happens with them.
3947,691f4afa049f,They try to say they were getting something that fell or telling one of there passengers in the back to stop knowing all they have to say is i was texting.
3948,691f4afa049f,I feel like we should have this thing in the future where we get in the car our phones automatically turn off so then there would be no problem with anything.
3949,691f4afa049f,I say this because it's better than doing that one stupid thing then risking however many lives are in thart car.

3978,034aaa8dbe3a,Which would leed to bad joint pain and expensive doctor bills.
3979,319b89f57567,Plus think of how crowded the side walks would be.
3980,319b89f57567,Your kids would get lost or even stolen right out from under your nose now do you really want that
3981,244efb3fff7e,Automobiles have been around forever why ruin what people worked so hard to gain

3992,b39405b1af00,Luke Bomberger was a seagoing cowboy.
3993,b39405b1af00,He crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and the Pacific twice to help people affected by world war ll.
3994,b39405b1af00,"He took care of horses, young cows, and mules that were shipped overseas."
3995,b39405b1af00,Along his trip he got chance to visit many places.
3996,b39405b1af00,He had the benefit of seeing Europe and China.
3997,b39405b1af00,"But to him seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special he also said that taking that gondola ride in Venice, Italy also was."
3998,b39405b1af00,He fed and watered the animals and cleaned the stalls.
3999,b39405b1af00,Bales of hay and bags of oats had to be pulled from the lower holds of the ship and thats what Luke did.
4000,b39405b1af00,During the crossings caring for the animals kept Luke busy.
4001,b39405b1af00,He was a watchman and had to look out on the animals every hour and report back to the captian.
4002,b39405b1af00,"One day he was doing his normal rutien, and he had slid down a slippery ladder an his backside and when he slid a small strip of metal along the edge stopped his slide, kepping from falling overboard in the Atlantic ocean."
4003,b39405b1af00,Helping on his aunt Katie's farm when he was young had prepared luke for hard work.
4004,e2652d8fb2f8,"
In the story it tells you of a man named Luke Bomberger and what he did as a Seagoing Cowboy."
4005,08c50a279dcc,It doesn't really try to convince you to participate in the program but if you do you can get some details from what he did to what you might do if you joined.
4006,0c52b57766f9,"After this program he said ""it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."""
4007,08b95ab318f4,The technogy that there using it looks wonderful explain every single details how the techonology works and how the testing are.
4008,08b95ab318f4,"It explain that they make a machine that can read face and pictures just like the Mona Lisa face, they describe that

Mona lisa have 83 percent happy , 9 percent disgusting, 6 percent fearful and 2 percent angry."
4009,08b95ab318f4,They explain this just because of a software computer read Mona Lisa face.
4010,cd1fecd3da8f,The coumputers are very smart at this time but a computer that reads face is a little bit complicated because they can do almost everything that a human wants but reading face is not so hard.
4011,e23182a9c478,Using technology to read emotions expressions of students in classroom is not so good
4012,390642db20f6,because students can read faces too.
4013,390642db20f6,A lot of people can read faces even if your mad or not people can see emotional in other faces .
4014,ed6369a64ac6,The process of the software computer begin when the computer constructus a 3-D computer model of the face.
4015,ed6369a64ac6,"it explain that thhe computer jus move muscle and the way faces move like in paragraph 3 describe "" all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."
4016,ed6369a64ac6,"Movement of one or more muscles is called an action unit ""."
4017,ed6369a64ac6,this mean that they read the muscle in the face to explain what motion humans do.
4018,7aaaa2ca9dce,"Reading faces is not so hard you can see people if they are happy,angry or sad is not so hard if see someone laughing you can tell that the person is happy"
4019,5bdec4f77f10,"or something make happy that person, like in the artticle say "" In fact, we humas perform this same impressive "" calculation "" every day ."
4020,5bdec4f77f10,"For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."""
4021,5bdec4f77f10,this mean that most people can show feelings on their face.
4022,5bdec4f77f10,Of course some people have trouble to describe faces because some people doesn't show feelings and other do.
4023,9a16b6b62945,How people feel it depends on them.
4024,9a16b6b62945,most people are happy and others sad but every single people can be happy it depends on them not in other persons.
4025,9a16b6b62945,The people that are always happy are the ones who thinks positive the ones that love their self
4026,30abd9f9c8ad,a machine can read their faces but the machine doesn't know that humans can change their mind
4027,569270f23c00,"in less than an minute we can be happy and then we can be sad for a sad news but for the computer it will take time to know when human change emotions because it has to read I again the whole face , compare to us the human can see fast when other person get sad."
4028,569270f23c00,"like a quote it say ""The Mona Lisa desmonstrate ir really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do""."
4029,569270f23c00,this mean that the computer is smart it can read faces .
4030,42fc10dd4f61,The technology is good for in some reason but reading faces too easy for human and humans doens't need a computer to tell hom the other person is feeling becuase humans can read faces too.
4031,42fc10dd4f61,their is no reason that human need a computer to tell them when ever a person is sad or happy.
4032,42fc10dd4f61,Humans can just look at their faces just to see of they are happy or sad.
4033,2b6b3d1acc13,"Summer is a time of relaxation, fun, and time to spend with family and friends."
4034,2b6b3d1acc13,Summer can also be a time for a great off season for sports and a time to get better at your crafts.
4035,2b6b3d1acc13,Many parents and teachers believe that the summer should be a time to really work on your mistakes or bad habits you've made over the school year.
4036,2b6b3d1acc13,"Whether its studying a subject, practicing a sport, or even working on your behavior."
4037,2b6b3d1acc13,Over the summer some schools assign projects for students to do
4038,c6e64886103a,"I believe that summer projects should be student-designed, but teacher's must approve their work."
4039,0f3c48752d92,If students were able to design their own summer projects then they would be able to truly use their unique creativity
4040,69efcb6c5845,Students would have the ability to choose a project idea that they like and not some boring project that a teacher may choose.
4041,69efcb6c5845,Also more and more students would actually do their projects because they would choose an idea that would be enjoyable.
4042,69efcb6c5845,"Teachers shouldn't judge your based on the work that they give you, but on the ideas that you come up with."
4043,69efcb6c5845,I think more teachers should allow kids to use their own creativity instead of making students into robots and giving them instructions that they must follow.
4044,d05be781314f,"In today's society, managers don't hire people based on their high school grades, but on their creativity and their great ideas that they could bring to the table."
4045,d05be781314f,"If you want to become a manager of a company or even an entrepreneur, you must have great ideas."
4046,d05be781314f,You must also be able to use your own creativity to persuade people to join your company or buy your products.
4047,d05be781314f,"Your teacher isn't going to just come up with your ideas when you get older, so why should they now."
4048,d05be781314f,"The younger you are at learning how to come up with your own ideas and how to be more creative, the more you're going to flourish as you get older."
4049,c8af298a0a6a,Some may say that teacher-designed summer projects would be better because it may be harder and challenge the students more.
4050,c8af298a0a6a,Also teacher-designed projects may relate to school more and what they might learn in the future because many teachers have a lot of experience.
4051,c8af298a0a6a,Student's may also have a hard time coming up with their own ideas and could take longer
4052,32225f6ab024,"But this is why I think students should come up with their own project designs and then have the teachers check their idea before they start working, so that their project isn't too easy or short"
4053,55bce088247f,Student's would also have to use their brain more and will teach them that they will struggle later in life because creating your own ideas aren't easy.
4054,55bce088247f,This will better prepare them in the future and will allow them to truly show/express their creativity to the rest of society.
4055,e3a1dea22051,"In the future, our society isn't going to change based on what students get on their exams, but on the ideas that they come up with."
4056,e3a1dea22051,Our ideas will truly affect the belief's of our society.
4057,e3a1dea22051,"This is why I think teacher's should allow students to come up with their own project designs so that they will learn how to use their creativity in order to benefit themselves, but more importantly, how to benefit others."
4058,e3a1dea22051,I've already seen so many younger people use their ideas to better help our environments and create less pollution in the homes of animals.
4059,e3a1dea22051,I think our world can continue to improve and become a better place by the ideas that we come up using our creativity.
4060,1b04c2eb073f,Imagine being on break an a student has to to do a project on bird which can be very boring and not interesting.
4061,1b04c2eb073f,Now the student is confused about the concept of the essay and is starting to give up.
4062,1b04c2eb073f,So break is about to end in the student is not motivated at all to finish project.
4063,1b04c2eb073f,Now the student stressed and worried if he/she is going to finish or not.
4064,1ff07a54bbf5,Summer projects should be student-designed
4065,9952969689e2,it is less stressful
4066,3a6f91666385,students will be more organized
4067,dc417d32f631,it will teach students how to be independent.
4068,77e081505692,students will be more focused on the project because it is coming from the students perspective and not assigned from a teacher.
4069,77e081505692,This can also help students with being more responsible.
4070,0dc20cac161b,For an example a person is working and your boss tells he/she to do something and that person do not do it.
4071,0dc20cac161b,There is an big chance of that person getting fired because he/she did not do what they we're suppose to do.
4072,0dc20cac161b,which can affect what they do in their life and can impacted the way they handle situation.
4073,8c5b6b5dc6e4,Second student will be more interested because students are designing the project other than just a teacher telling them what to do
4074,e8fdb5094aed,This could also help with students being more organized when it comes to importuning things.
4075,20ca93f3dcc2,For an example my friend was looking for an expensive pair of shoes that he put somewhere in his closet.
4076,20ca93f3dcc2,But he can't find them in there because his closet is a complete mess.
4077,20ca93f3dcc2,But if he was organized than he would not had lost them in his closet.
4078,20ca93f3dcc2,This shows if your not organized then theirs a possibilities that you might misplace something thats importuning.
4079,bf6c978c1db2,This can also teach students how to do things independent and do things alone.
4080,10dbe421d05d,This can show that students always not going to have someone to ask for help or someone to guide them.
4081,10dbe421d05d,This is going to help them to find a way through because in life it is not going to always be easy.
4082,10dbe421d05d,"For an example, My dad was battling cancer and he had a lot of obstacles in his life but he always managed to fight threw the battle."
4083,10dbe421d05d,Their we're times he was down but he always managed to pick himself up.
4084,10dbe421d05d,This show that there is always going to be problems but just dont give up.
4085,1f164681c152,Finally students can now enjoy their break and not have to worry about the teacher with the uninteresting project.
4086,1f164681c152,"Summer projects should be student-designed because it is less stressful, students will be more organized, and it will teach students how to be independent."

4096,4baf66d92d2a,The scientist would taker such a risk to because NASA is inhancing their technology.
4097,4baf66d92d2a,"NASA is even building "" mechanical computers"" which was important to World War 2 becasue of the calculations it made."
4098,4baf66d92d2a,If this computer made calculations for the war then it would probably have a lot of effect to the scientist on exploring Venus.
4099,70adf41f85b5,"Even though Venus is a dangerous risk, people and experts would love to know the knowledge that the planet will give us."
4100,70adf41f85b5,We also woudln't have as big as a risk if these technologies would work out.
4101,70adf41f85b5,Maybe the scientsit aren't so wrong on this mission I mena they are experts.
4102,70adf41f85b5,"Scientit would love to the risk to expirence Venus, give information to others, and have our society grow more in education."

4104,7b5566d899e5,But if i were you i wouldve choosen to walk because it very good for you because its like if you were doing exersice.
4105,3102b0eb879d,"A lot of people perfere to drve a car because there probably too lazy or something lol, th reason they like driving because its the fastest thing to go somewere quick,"
4106,fd84a15872d1,"but you know its that big advantage about a car but the thing that sucks about a car you have to put gas in it, and thats oretty expensive for some people but thtas why some rich people are the only ones to be able to put gas in it."

4108,548d5e194176,"If my principal were to declare that all students were obligated to participate in an extracurricular activity, I would be less than pleased with the idea."
4109,3ec26d70a904,I do not believe students should be made to do anything outside of the curriculum by their education system.
4110,3ec26d70a904,The mere concept of this rule being enforced shows a lack of understanding or compassion from schools.
4111,76bd0bf6d6fe,I believe that extracurricular activities are perfectly fine.
4112,0c70f5612bdc,"Clubs like ""We the People"" are great for those who are interested in American history or writing, and playing sports is perfect for exercise, to no one's surprise."
4113,0c70f5612bdc,"They are a wonderful way of expanding horizons, making friends and exploring new things."
4114,d4f30ca6f400,"But that's exactly how they should remain:

extracurricular."
4115,d4f30ca6f400,"As in, outside of the required learning and entirely optional."
4116,887982f8dec5,Students should be free to choose whether they do or don't participate in activities outside of the standard school day.
4117,887982f8dec5,"If a student's parents require him or her to do a club or sport, however, that is a very different case."
4118,887982f8dec5,"Parents have a say in what their child does, and they have every right to decide if the student will participate in any type of organization."
4119,887982f8dec5,Schools do not and should not have the same level of involvement.
4120,93865cd9f12e,turning extracurricular activities into a mandatory affair is either a waste of student time or class time.
4121,65f4405980a9,"Although making clubs compulsory perhaps sounded like a good idea, not only is it a bad one, it's a time-wasting one."
4122,65f4405980a9,"If every single student will do an extra activity, then by that logic, schools would just add an hour to the school day, which I know would not go over well with many."
4123,65f4405980a9,"Besides, students already have significant amounts of homework from various classes."
4124,65f4405980a9,Adding another obligatory activity to dedicate time to could very well be too much.
4125,65f4405980a9,Making extracurricular activities mandatory is also just disrespectful to many family's schedules.
4126,65f4405980a9,"Maybe a student had already been participating in a separate, unrelated activity or organization."
4127,65f4405980a9,"It could be that the student has a religious practice after school, or he or she has to take care of a family member."
4128,65f4405980a9,The examples are endless.
4129,65f4405980a9,"Nevertheless, schools should not take up student's time outside of school any more than they already do."
4130,802277eb00a4,"if the school system somehow managed to squeeze in enough time for an extracurricular activity for everybody without adding any time to the school day, it could potentially be wasteful of the teacher's already limited teaching time."
4131,fbe606e893a7,"If we only have 45 minutes per class right now, imagine how little it would be adding another period."
4132,fbe606e893a7,Educators would be in a constant struggle to cram enough information in such a short class time.
4133,fbe606e893a7,"If this did happen, it could be very possible that the school year might be stretched out so students could properly learn the concepts, which would leave many students and teachers who love summer vacation with disappointing news."
4134,36b8abe7fb82,I firmly believe that making extracurricular activities compulsory for students is not a good idea.
4135,36b8abe7fb82,"Those activities are meant to be optional, and if every student were to do them schools would have to monopolize everybody's personal time by extending the school day, drain the little instructional time teachers have by shortening their classes, or elongate the entire school year."
4136,36b8abe7fb82,"While at first it may seem like a terrific idea, various cracks start to reveal themselves at second glance."
4137,36b8abe7fb82,"In the end, I don't think the idea would have worked."
4138,9ebe42a623b1,"because he said the sun is more colse from us and mars is more close from the sun but he said tahat venus is actually a planet and hes telling us a lot about the planets and about the ones are more close from us and about the stars he talking to and the planets surface temperatures average over 800 degrees the earth, venus and mars are neighbor orbit the sun at different speeed."
4139,9ebe42a623b1,"these are dfferent on speed and venus is one of the brighest points of light in the night at the sky venus is a planer in our solar system, but i think the earth and venus are likr twings because iif i thinkg they are th same size and i think the same mass and space and in space terms humans have snet numerous spacecraft to land on this almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus even more over 800 degrees fahrenheit and the atmospheri pressure is 90 times greater"
4140,4f8183697421,"if our sister planet is so inhospitable, why are scientists even discussing"
4141,4d71b88e079f,The scienties are trying to put humans on the planted venus they say its human temp there so we can live there.
4142,4d71b88e079f,They say there are dangers stuff in venus they still have to see ow would they grow food and kill animals and take it down there.
4143,4d71b88e079f,I think this is a good idea becuase it would make the earth a lot smaller in population and not so packed acrroding to the artical venus is big.
4144,4d71b88e079f,"Sometimes where closer to mucrey then venus and sometimes were closer to venus, venus is one of our plantes and someday some people will live on them its cool how we never thought these planets would be used and now people are so smart."
4145,4d71b88e079f,That they make rockets to see how it looks and deel like on other planet of cours it nothing on there yet one dsay weveryone should be able to go there and live and see how it is but a lot of people will get sick because of water issues not the same water u been drinking waether is gooan not be the same.
4146,c1dfb919c4b1,Over the years many schools have assigned summer projects as a way to help keep students minds active while on break.
4147,c1dfb919c4b1,"These projects can include reflection essays, construction, reading catalogs, and many other wonderful things."
4148,c1dfb919c4b1,"At the moment many of these projects are designed by the teachers, however many schools are considering switching to projects designed by the students."
4149,21b6f32b48b8,Students designed teacher approved projects would be better for the future of education
4150,d273c2b0366d,"they would allow students to think critically,"
4151,0bcf56951827,"increase their desire to learn,"
4152,e579b703d0c5,tailor projects to their strengths and learning styles.
4153,a6c188222975,Most teacher designed projects rely on specific structures and check list drawn up by the teacher for the students to fallow.
4154,a6c188222975,"They do no prompt the students to: think, learn, ponder, and reflect, rather they give students a list of mundane tasks to complete and check off."
4155,a6c188222975,Critical thinking and complex learning comes from hands on practice thought and refection.
4156,a6c188222975,"Giving a student a complex prompt or problem and allowing them to design the project themselves in order to answer it, stimulates the brain far more than handing the student an assignment where the answers have already been neatly planed and laid out by the teacher."
4157,a6c188222975,"For a better education students need to be able to solve problems on their own and chart their own waters, they will never grow if they are always defendant on a teacher to tell them what to do and how to do it."
4158,362e45b76299,"Often times struggling students or children who ""hate"" school may just feel bored and there are many students who don't try in school because they feel like the subjects they study have no purpose or that it will have no value for their future career."
4159,362e45b76299,These students often do not participate in teacher designed summer projects as many see summer as their time off from the burden of school and teacher projects appear as boring and useless to them.
4160,362e45b76299,"If these students were allowed to design hear projects, however, so that they focused on topics important to them there could very well be an increase in their participation and desire to learn."
4161,362e45b76299,When people study things they like and enjoy the often perform better this can be seen at schools like the Generic_School MATA programs where every student who attends wants to be there and as a result they are active and engaged each day.
4162,362e45b76299,"It can be inferred that if the logic applied to the MATA programs is applied to summer projects, students studying things they enjoy increases learning motivation, more students would participate and find value in summer projects."
4163,325c88e361c9,While many teachers say no child left behind that is often not the case with summer projects.
4164,325c88e361c9,Because these projects are assigned before the teacher gets the chance to really know the students a it is difficult to adjust to a students specific needs.
4165,325c88e361c9,"A teacher may assign project with lots of heavy reading not knowing that a few of her students are dyslexic, or a different teacher may assign something on a topic many of the students are already well versed in so it has little value to repeat it."
4166,325c88e361c9,Student designed projects would avoid these conflicts as the students know themselves best and could be able to tailor their project to their strengths.
4167,325c88e361c9,"Many English classes have already found success in doing this where instead of assigning books that students may have already read or are difficult for some to read, these classes allow students to study books of their choice or listen to audio books."
4168,325c88e361c9,Student designed projects are often more applicable to students lives and as a result they are a better form of education and learning than teacher designed projects.
4169,468ba2223a46,Some may contradict that student designed projects would promote laziness and the students would not learn anything of value from them.
4170,468ba2223a46,This is why these projects would have to be teacher approved;
4171,2579a3e8aec7,"however, even if they are not the value of learning to think and the other benefits of student designed projects outweighs the over specified structure of the teacher designed projects."
4172,ba370e3adb71,"In the end student designed projects are most beneficial to students due to their freedom to allow for critical thinking, the study of subjects students enjoy increasing learning motivations, and their unique ability to be tailored to each students needs."
4173,693c16fab0ba,The technology used in the article shouldn't be used to read students emotional expressions
4174,b2daa16541ad,They shouldn't because if a student is very sad or upset even angry you'll want to know why and probably ask them why they feel that way.
4175,b2daa16541ad,"Some students might want to talk about it,"
4176,7a3c7c5f125d,but most probably wouldn't so it might make them even more upset or angry and sad if you ask whats wrong and they dont want to talk about it.
4177,7a3c7c5f125d,Also if it a personal issue the student is having and they tell you what's wrong and you can't help them they might feel like they're doing something wrong and get sad or depressed becasue you can't help them.
4178,ed2c2d4aec6a,Also if this was used to read the emotinal expressions of students in the classroom I feel like it would be a distraction and take time out of the students learing to figure out how every student is feeling based on the facial expressions
4179,2a49bb2a4078,"Another thing could be what of the technology making this possible is wrong, so you walk up to a student and ask them why they're so happy but they are actually really sad."
4180,8051d2a3939d,What if the student just changes their apperance to make them look a different way when they are read for their emotion.
4181,846665925602,The last thing is what are the teachers going to do with the imfomation on how they think their students are feeling based on a facial expression
4182,2649f677ef49,"Maybe in a college where you want to be a consuler or something along those lines it would be a good thing to have to teach you how to read others emotions better,"
4183,8807f967414d,but it would be useless in a middle or high school classroom and just cause distractions.
4184,110e241a098a,"
This shows why I dont think the technology would be good in the classroom."
4185,110e241a098a,Becasue the technology could be wrong.
4186,110e241a098a,Students could change their apparence to seem a different way.
4187,110e241a098a,And it's useless to the teachers to have this information.
4188,284bd05be371,"Computers don't have emotions, but you do!"
4189,284bd05be371,"Imagine technology that seriously works for you, not only at home but also in the classroom!"
4190,284bd05be371,If technology could accurately read human facial expressions the learning possibilities could be endless.
4191,284bd05be371,"For example, think about that one story that you're forced to read that you just can't understand and brings out all your frustrations, with facial expression recognition you probably will never be so frustated again."
4192,73a45fc59101,The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom is unbelievably valuable.
4193,c5fe114149f9,"
Technology in the classroom has already begun to advance rapidly with educational websites such as ; Google Classroom, Edulastic, Khan Academy,and Mathia."
4194,c5fe114149f9,The facial recognition technology could enhance a students comprehension to maximum potential.
4195,0dc1233b54c5,"In the passage "" Making Mona Lisa Smile"" the author states in paragraph 6 line 6,""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,""Dr Huang predicts."
4196,0dc1233b54c5,"""then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."
4197,0dc1233b54c5,""",this kind of technology can possibly boost testing score and even help children falling behind instead of holding them back another year."
4198,0dc1233b54c5,"The text also states in paragraph 6 line 10 that ;""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communcation,""notes Dr."
4199,0dc1233b54c5,"Huang.""."
4200,0dc1233b54c5,"This example actually explains alot of real world issues in the classroom, such as the fact that some students refuse to even try to communicate their confusion or boredom in the classroom so then they often disengage in the lesson and miss every part that would be essential to reaching standards created by the state."
4201,a020f836fd18,"Many parents or administrators may not agree that this sounds real or possible,"
4202,ef1cab9001d0,but the logic is right before our eyes.
4203,d123b3c731da,In the text the author states how the technology performs the task of reading emotional appeals.
4204,d123b3c731da,"For example, in paragraph 3 line 1 the author says,""The process begins when the com puter constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles."
4205,d123b3c731da,"Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit""."
4206,d123b3c731da,"So apparently this process goes beyond just looking at the face,but actually looking for the movements in facial muscles."
4207,d123b3c731da,"The author also talks about the muscles that present certain emotions such as the ; the muscles above your eyes (frontalis oars lateralis) raise when you're surprised,the muscles around your mouth (orbicularis oris) tightens your lips when you're angry, and more."
4208,d123b3c731da,This shows that the computer breaks facial expressions down to a science.
4209,5ca720099a80,So now what do you think?
4210,5ca720099a80,"Computers advance more and more everyday, however facial recognition may just be the beginning."
4211,5ca720099a80,Learning in classroom has become based on all technology in many different forms.
4212,5ca720099a80,Facial tachnology will broaden our horizons with better test scores and happier students that can understand the material evn better than before!
4213,5ca720099a80,The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in a classroom could be a life changing improvement in the 21st century since every student has different wants and needs as far their education.
4214,a76e1864b0a1,Many schools across the country require students to complete summer assignments to assure that they continue their pursuit of knowledge even without a teacher present.
4215,a76e1864b0a1,But should these assignments be designed by the teacher or should they be designed by the student?
4216,a76e1864b0a1,"If a student were given freedom with their project, it would be a lot more enjoyable rather than if a teacher put strict conditions on it."
4217,a76e1864b0a1,But a lack of strictness would mean that students are less likely to complete their project and they wouldn't know when the work they have done is enough
4218,1a9843527ce3,Teachers should put that restriction on the student and give them a specific assignment to ensure that the appropriate amount of work gets done.
4219,2591819b15f7,"Students are less likely to complete a project that they have freedom on and if they do complete it, the quality would suffer greatly compared to if a teacher gave them a prompt or a specific task to accomplish."
4220,22710b811e88,The point of a summer assignment is to prevent to student from losing knowledge or getting rusty because of a break.
4221,22710b811e88,"Although the point of the summer break is to let students relax until the next year starts, it's still important that they keep their studies up."
4222,22710b811e88,"Assignments shouldn' be student-designed because that would allow too much leisure and when school comes around, most students would not have it done."
4223,22710b811e88,"For example, I had two summer assignments last summer."
4224,22710b811e88,One was for English and one was for Math.
4225,22710b811e88,"For the English one, the assignment was to read any book of my choosing and write a review about it."
4226,22710b811e88,"This assignment had very unclear instructions and I, the student, was supposed to add my own twist to it and complete the assignment however I wanted to."
4227,22710b811e88,"I started on the assignment, but never finished it because I didn't have the motive since there was no specific prompt to answer to, so I wrote a couple of sentences and called it quits."
4228,22710b811e88,"But for the Math assignment, I had a packet to complete of practice problems."
4229,22710b811e88,The finish was in sight and crystal clear.
4230,22710b811e88,I did it throughout the summer and finished it by August.
4231,22710b811e88,"The reassurance I felt that once I did a specific amount of work and followed the teacher's directions, I would be done is what encouraged me to finish."
4232,22710b811e88,The English assignment was unclear and I didn't know how much to complete to make sure that I was on track for next year.
4233,efb6831124cf,"to give the student reassurance and to make sure the student doesn't do too much work over what's supposed to be a break, yet it keeps them on track."
4234,d0a7fd355097,"If an assignment is student-designed then the student will do one of three things: overwork themselves, not fully apply their capabilities, or not do the work at all."
4235,43d3f4ce3209,"For these reasons, summer assignments should all be teacher-designed."
4236,337e2d578a2c,Mars hasn't stayed the same over the years.

4242,cd33a16eaf77,Peole started to imidiately think this was created by aliens.
4243,cd33a16eaf77,That was still to be figured out.
4244,cd33a16eaf77,Over the next 25 years scientists studied Mars to determine if this was created by aliens or its just a natural landform.
4245,cd33a16eaf77,"Scientist have been using many different spacecrafts to better understand the ""face""."

4254,16b3df2f5c10,While mobile devices are useful in everyday life
4255,5d0180e94ebc,they are hazardous and in some cases deadly when a vehicle is involved.
4256,85774cd41d6f,"Devices cause distractions that can put not only the driver of the vehicle at risk but also those inside the vehicles, and the people all around the car."
4257,85774cd41d6f,"Distracted driving is one of the most dangerous types of driving and according to Edger Snyder & Associates, ""the use of cell phones while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes every year"" (Edgar Snyder & Associates ""Texting and Driving Accident Statistics - Distracted Driving"")."

4265,3ca8c776242e,The dangers that distracted drivers place not only themselves but also those around them is completely unnecessary.
4266,3ca8c776242e,The dangers not only lie on the road but they also extend to after the crash takes place.
4267,a8300a3637f3,One of the other major issues that distracted drivers face is the financial costs incurred after the initial wreck.
4268,588f4ff15353,"The people that suffer the most financial damage are the drivers, followed by their passengers, and then pedestrians involved in the accident."
4269,588f4ff15353,"Some reason drivers suffer the most is because they are left paying for the damages to the cars and for personal injuries, not to mention their insurance premiums potentially increase."
4270,588f4ff15353,The passengers and pedestrians suffer because of bodily injuries and potential long term recuperation.
4271,588f4ff15353,"While they likely do not have to pay for vehicle damages, if severe enough, injuries prevent them from performing their day to day activities and work functions, which may leave them unable to work and without money to survive."

4273,588f4ff15353,"So the cost for the accident far outweighs the risk of texting or calling while they are driving, not to mention the potential risk of injury not only for themself but for everyone involved in the accident."
4274,ca209cce7abf,"
On top of the financial and physical pain these types of accidents cause, there is also the emotional pain of the victims and the victim's families."
4275,5d990e79d307,"When a victim survives and they are injured, they can't immediately go back to work, school, or their normal lives."
4276,5d990e79d307,They need to go to physical rehabilitation which causes strain on everyone involved.
4277,5d990e79d307,"Along with this, there are mental disorders that develop after the crash, one of which is depression."
4278,5d990e79d307,"According to the Myers Law Firm ""Some physical injuries limit victims' ability to work, exercise, and enjoy day-to-day activities like playing with their children."
4279,5d990e79d307,"If you're suddenly unable to partake in activities that you used to enjoy because of pain or a debilitating injury, it's no surprise you may become depressed"" (Myers Law Firm 2020)."
4280,5d990e79d307,"The victims may have difficulty adjusting to a new ""normal"" caused by injuries."
4281,5d990e79d307,"These injuries may have caused a lack of mobility or body function, which hinders them from enjoying typical family or personal activities."
4282,5d990e79d307,Things they loved to do in the past that could be spontaneous or done in a few minutes now require extra time and planning to accomplish.
4283,5d990e79d307,Another mental illness that could develop is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
4284,5d990e79d307,PTSD may make going back to their normal day to day lives very difficult.
4285,5d990e79d307,"Often time people involved in wrecks will have flashbacks about it, sometimes triggered by being in a car, being near the wreck site or something completely unrelated."
4286,5d990e79d307,"Not only is the physical and financial cost of such an accident steep, but the mental toll has a hefty cost."
4287,e0cc245e11dc,"Aside from the mental, physical, and financial sides of the argument there is also the legal side of it."
4288,e0cc245e11dc,"Many states are starting to realize the dangers of distracted driving and are prohibiting it, and if anyone is caught they will either be fined or sentenced to serve in jail for a short time."
4289,4d47590043fe,One example of a state that has made using a mobile device while behind the wheel of a vehicle is Georgia.
4290,4d47590043fe,"The hands-free law states that ""A driver cannot have a phone in their hand or use any part of their body to support their phone...A driver may not write, send or read any text messages, e-mails, social media or internet data content""(""Hands-Free Law"")."
4291,4d47590043fe,"The states understand that the use of mobile devices while operating a vehicle is dangerous, and they are starting to enforce that they need to get it under control."
4292,c086180b20e5,The use of a mobile device should not be allowed while driving a vehicle.
4293,c086180b20e5,Some states are moving to make it illegal.
4294,c086180b20e5,The accidents cause high financial damage which supports the reasoning of the states to make it illegal.
4295,c086180b20e5,"The many deaths, physical injuries and emotional strain that if inficts far outweighs any possible need for using a phone."
4296,c086180b20e5,The final reason that states are making it illegal to drive distracted is because of the high amount of crashes that it causes.
4297,c086180b20e5,It is because of all these factors that the use of mobile devices while behind the wheel of any vehicle should be completely and utterly prohibited.
4298,70d6e4610f05,Summer break is a time for everyone to decompress and relax after a long school year.
4299,70d6e4610f05,"Projects over break are stressful, especially teacher-designed ones."
4300,70d6e4610f05,Breaks should be spent having fun and spending time with family/friends.
4301,70d6e4610f05,Students work their butts of enough during the year and shouldnt have to do that over summer.
4302,690c9b7d12e8,Summer projects should be student-designed
4303,10c5d3d02855,"it'll give students a chance to make the project chill,"
4304,0ab25d33e706,"it will allow more independence for the students,"
4305,bfa21debc1cf,it will have a better chance of making the students summer adventurous.
4306,3e844a0bee7e,The one thing students ask of the most would be a laid back summer.
4307,3e844a0bee7e,"Because of all the stress they endure during the year, students want a bit of time to reflect and relax."
4308,3e844a0bee7e,If students make their own projects they could make it very simple.
4309,3e844a0bee7e,"Most may think of that as taking a shortcut through life, but in reality they do enough work as it is in school."
4310,3e844a0bee7e,"If teachers made the projects, chances are they'd want to challenge the students a lot."
4311,3e844a0bee7e,When projects are teacher-designed students are less likely to complete it.
4312,3e844a0bee7e,To add on students wouldn't want to ruin their schedule with a boring project that their teacher designed; they'd want their project to be less time consuming during break.
4313,061d9642e529,One key factor for students is a sense of independence.
4314,061d9642e529,Students are growing older and majority of them want to do tasks on their own.
4315,061d9642e529,Doing their own projects would give them that freedom.
4316,5359e5f732de,The project could also be a way for them to boost their confidence in what they are capable of doing.
4317,5359e5f732de,It would be a great way for them to see how being independent with certain things is like.
4318,5359e5f732de,Student-designed projects may be a way for students to teach themselves responsibility.
4319,5359e5f732de,It would give them a greater aspect of being able to deal with time management skills.
4320,5359e5f732de,"Furthermore they wouldn't be relying on their teachers for specific things such as: making a due date, setting up the project, making specific directions, etc."
4321,c60681df89dd,Most students enjoy exploring over summer; and what better way to do it than through a project.
4322,c60681df89dd,Student-designed projects would allow students to create it however they want.
4323,c60681df89dd,Even if it's a group project or even one where they'd need to actually go somewhere.
4324,c60681df89dd,"Teachers wouldn't make it all that interesting, they'd just add a few things to make it ""fun"" but not to where a student would get excited."
4325,c60681df89dd,"If students want more time with friends and family, they could add things into the project to make that happen."
4326,c60681df89dd,"Teachers are known as the ""fun killers"", so students would get the chance to take matters into their own hands and fix that."
4327,36f6b8bbfd91,"Overall people may think teacher-designed projects are better because of teachers ""knowing what they are doing"","
4328,1ca6ae613c0a,but that is not always true.
4329,1ca6ae613c0a,It is good to let students take over sometimes.
4330,1ca6ae613c0a,It is also a great way for teachers to see the potential for their students.
4331,e60f15293de6,Student- designed projects can show one's creativity and imagination.
4332,e60f15293de6,Teachers don't always get to see that side of students during the year.
4333,f7a5e689fa6d,"To conclude it all students should be able to design their own projects to attain their independence, add some adventure to their break, and gain a relaxing summer break."
4334,a165afa5eb16,"I think using a Facial Action Coding Systemin the classroom to identify the emotions of students is not okay,"
4335,59d5d85646d1,Why?
4336,59d5d85646d1,becuase some people want to express themselves of their feelings that has been done by others.
4337,59d5d85646d1,But not such that.
4338,59d5d85646d1,"In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everday."
4339,59d5d85646d1,For instance you can probably tell if a friend is feeling simply emotion by looking at thair face.
4340,59d5d85646d1,But for some people painting portraits can help them express their feelings through painting.
4341,59d5d85646d1,Sometimes people express their emotions through music by singing or making music.
4342,59d5d85646d1,"Then in the Mona Lisa, no one knows what feeling she is expressing and what is she feeling."
4343,59d5d85646d1,"For instance, some artists say she is happy but no one really knows what emotion she is feeling"
4344,fe38c88f6925,"In conclusion, I think classrooms shouldn't use Facial Action Coding System to identify the expression of students an how they are feeling."
4345,fe38c88f6925,But some people have hidden talents that they use to express themselves or their emotions.
4346,fe38c88f6925,"Also not many people icluding students express themselves through painting some use dancing, acting, making music, singing, cooking and their are many ways of expressing your emotions through many things."
4347,fe38c88f6925,"For instance people express themselves through writing books, but many people can understand their feelings that by reading their life as a book."
4348,7ce471a8cd33,"Yes, the use of Facial Action Codying Stystem would be very useful for students in the classroom."
4349,377557a55679,"Not only can this technology detect when a student is confused or bored, but it can change the lesson to grab the students' attention again, or to explain it in an another way."
4350,e3e829595bc4,"Along with this, this technology could introduce a lot more job intrest, hobby intrest, or just pure intrest among students."
4351,0b783745a00f,"Lastly, this technology would be beneficial to students because it would give us a reason to be taught about the science of emotion, we could learn and go more into depth about our basic human body and mind and how easy emotions can show."
4352,7d8dcbe6751e,"This technology can change lessons for kids who aren't understanding, or are just completley bored of the material being shown."
4353,1cbba736bc56,"This can greatly change a students grades from bad to good, along with make them look forward to coming to your class or school in general."
4354,1cbba736bc56,"From paragraph 6 the author stated, ""A classroom computer could recongnize when a student is becoming confused or bored."""
4355,1cbba736bc56,"Ending the conversation with, ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instuctor."""
4356,1cbba736bc56,"Another point which dosn't relate to the fact of changing around lessons for a student would be also in paragraph 6,""...if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow."
4357,1cbba736bc56,"But if you frown, the next ad will be different."""
4358,1cbba736bc56,"This technology can overall make a students lesson, web browsing, and understanding of materal a lot easier and it could greatly improve their work."
4359,d4e58ec7115c,"Secondly, the FACS can show students a different range of technology that is fairly new"
4360,f5cd4212856d,"It could show some kids something they may be passionate for but never knew of, it could be a possible job intrest, a new hobby interest, anything at all."
4361,93fbfa5126af,"The people using this technology are doing so many things, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face;"" So they're not only using 3-D software but also, ""Using video imagery, the new emotion-recongnition software tracks these facial movements."""
4362,93fbfa5126af,"The people who are specializing in doing this kind of technology, are branching out in very large, and impactful ways."
4363,93fbfa5126af,"Many students could be interested in doing this, and sometimes if it's not in school and they don't hear of it."
4364,93fbfa5126af,They can never find it.
4365,91e358af81a9,"Lastly, having this technology in our school would give us a reason to talk about the basic science of emotion."
4366,219f71d2b1eb,"We can learn about our human bodies and why emotion is displayed so easily, and how it's displayed as well."
4367,219f71d2b1eb,"""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."""
4368,219f71d2b1eb,"Our faces can move in multiple ways depending on the emotion we feel, as shown in paragraphs 7-8."
4369,219f71d2b1eb,Why does it do this?
4370,219f71d2b1eb,"This technology can give us a valid reason to talk about the science of emotion more, and we can learn more about this as students or even as teachers."
4371,dad03cbc1630,"Finally, either it be the fact that a lesson can be changed based off of if a student is bored or confused."
4372,dad03cbc1630,"Or that having this technology can show students a wider range of possible job choices, hobby choices, or just learning more about something out of pure intrest."
4373,dad03cbc1630,"Or lastly, because having this technology around us gives us a reason to talk about the science of emotion in depth."
4374,dad03cbc1630,"This technology could be extreamly useful, and impactful on students, if the software being used is good and has been shown to be correct."
4375,dad03cbc1630,This could be a very good thing to have in schools that our students can use and to possibly even learn about.
4376,f2f0ce6fc24f,The author does a very good job of proving his point about the challanges of exploring Venus.
4377,f2f0ce6fc24f,He makes a few valid points and is very descriptive.
4378,f2f0ce6fc24f,I think he did a good job overall explaning his point.
4379,4ebed28eef27,He starts off by talking about how Venus is a very similar planet to ours
4380,230a4fd7d572,"He says hat the two planets are so similar that people call Venus the ""sister planet to Earth""."
4381,230a4fd7d572,He also makes the point that Venus may have held life at some point.
4382,230a4fd7d572,"He states that ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth""."
4383,19d73c2df3ca,His next topic was about how we have already sent space crafts over to Venus.
4384,19d73c2df3ca,"All of them, however, were unmanned"
4385,0a31bfc56e92,They were all unmanned because the pressure and heat of the planet would instantly kill the occupants inside the ship.
4386,0a31bfc56e92,"Even without anyone in the ships, the spaceships were still crushed by the pressure of the planet."
4387,0a31bfc56e92,"He states that ""no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours""."
4388,0a31bfc56e92,He then goes on to say that this is probably why no spaceships have touched the planet fr three decades.
4389,ae478f2a7fb7,He goes on to talk about how NASA has been trying to come up with ideas on how to inhabit the planet with life.
4390,ae478f2a7fb7,they came up with a few good ideas but the one that stood out to him the most was a bit interesting
4391,b72a1446558d,He says that NASA wanted to try and get a blimp like spaceshi to float 30 miles above Venus' surface.
4392,b72a1446558d,at ths spot it isnt too hot or too dangerous and is almost perfect for life.
4393,b72a1446558d,"the heat, however, would still be a whopping 170 degrees fahrenheit and we would be stuck in a thick cloud in CO2."
4394,b72a1446558d,"He also states that even if we lived there, we wouldnt be able to photograph or video the surface to study it."
4395,453315484a94,Overall he made a lot of valid points.
4396,453315484a94,I think that he made his point very clear and proved that attempting to explore Venus would be a challange.
4397,453315484a94,"With its harsh conditions and unbearable heat, there would be no fun in exploring the planet."
4398,0db0527c1b72,"Authors that present a well-developed, convincing argument can have a large influence on their reader's thoughts."
4399,0db0527c1b72,"In the passage, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author explains the different reasons as to why Earth, as a whole, should further study the planet of Venus, alotting all its difficulties."
4400,9585de902225,"While the kinks of being able to go to Venus are still being worked out, this author gives insight as to why this barren planet is still important."
4401,5fe27ee65267,The first idea the author had was related to the atmosphere of Venus
4402,92252c56a61f,"""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."
4403,92252c56a61f,"Even more challenging are the coulds of higly corrosive sufuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."""
4404,92252c56a61f,"In Paragraph 3, the author does not give a higly convincing argument."
4405,92252c56a61f,"Humans need oxygen to live, so how is it expected for them to survive on a planet that has little to no oxygen?"
4406,92252c56a61f,It is not possible to change the chemical makeup of an entire planet.
4407,92252c56a61f,The argument displayed by the author is not credible in any way and does not give any reason as to why one would want to continure research in this area.
4408,5c95b5228cd3,"The next problem that Earth faces in studying Venus is that temperatures on this planet exceed 800 degrees Fahrenheit, a temperature found nowhere on Earth"
4409,6423711c9a94,"This temperature is beyond the maximun limit that human can edure, which leaves behind the compelling factor of wanting to study more of this sister planet."
4410,6423711c9a94,"The author also states, ""."
4411,6423711c9a94,. . and the atmospheric pressure is 9 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.
4412,6423711c9a94,"These conditions are far more extreme that anything humans encounter on Earth."""
4413,6423711c9a94,"If the conditions of Venus are so bad, why should we be expected to study more of this planet."
4414,6423711c9a94,"Similar to the carbon dioxide in the air, there is no way to change the temperature and pressure of an entire planet."
4415,6423711c9a94,"Once again, the argument given by this author is not convincing."
4416,bd9e8168aba7,The author uses an idea proposed by NASA for humans to study Venus
4417,b506a3077514,"They say that they could use hovering vehcles such as a blimp to fly over the planet, somewhere around 30 miles high."
4418,b506a3077514,"While 30 miles is a long way abover the planet, the temperature would still be around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, which is not ideal for reseachers."
4419,b506a3077514,"""Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."""
4420,b506a3077514,"If studying a planet is as difficult as the author is saying here, then Venus should be abandoned because even if NASA was able to study it, there is obviously no way that the planet will ever be suitable to live on."
4421,b506a3077514,The author's arguments so far have all been a lost cause.
4422,bcae15553370,"The author does explain that Venus may have been previously similar to Earth-like conditions, including oceans to support forms of life"
4423,0397a4d8179e,"He states that it has similar features to Earth such as valleys, mountains, and craters."
4424,0397a4d8179e,"While this may be too, Venus has come a long way in that it is no longer able to sustain life."
4425,0397a4d8179e,"Even if it previously was similar to Earth, that means that it has gotten worse over time, which says that from here on, it will continue to grow worse."
4426,3f5c23685895,"Proven by the author, Venus's conditions are far too extreme for the technology we have today."
4427,3f5c23685895,"This planet is increasingly too dangerous to be explored, therefore the research toward it should be abandoned, and pushed more toward studying other plants, or even other solar systems in order to find another sutiable planet for humans to comfortably live on."
4428,20c0e467fcd4,I think its ok so you can know how the person is feeling
4429,c8287d40dac2,If you know how a person is feeling then you can react to them in a way.
4430,0df6ffdf90db,The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.
4431,0df6ffdf90db,"Eckman has classified six basic emotions- happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."
4432,0df6ffdf90db,If your in a classroom and you don't have one of those (FACS) then one day a student can come in all calm in the from out of nowhere there's a fight.
4433,0df6ffdf90db,"But with a FACS when that person comes in the room, and the computer scans the person and it shows that the person is angry."
4434,0df6ffdf90db,Now that the teacher knows that the person is angry an they can see if they can calm them down.
4435,0df6ffdf90db,"In paragraph 6 it's says ""a classroom coomputer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."""
4436,d8a64de47f9a,"First,Professor."
4437,d8a64de47f9a,"Thomas Huang of the beckman Institute for advanced Science at the University of Illinois working with

Professor."
4438,d8a64de47f9a,Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam.
4439,d8a64de47f9a,Dr. Huang and his colleague are developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate which the proces begin when a computer constructs a 3-D computer Model of the Human face that contains all 44 major muscles in the model that must move like Human.
4440,ab63bb9f4dec,"Second,The Facial Expressions of some individuals often show varying degrees of expression and the new emotion-recognition software tracks facial movements in a real face or in the painted face if Mona Lisa."
4441,ab63bb9f4dec,Each expression of a Human is being compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).
4442,ab63bb9f4dec,"In fact us Humans perform the same impressive ""calculation"" everyday."
4443,684f0be44e4c,"Third,Mona Lisa's Demonstration really intended to bring a smile on your face, For example: if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen a similar ad will follow but if your frown the next ad will be different,which makes the classroom computer recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored then it could modify the lesson like an effective human instructor and with the same technology it can be used to make computer-animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery."
4444,d8ffca6952f2,"Last,Our Muscles called Orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's feet around your eyes, in a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major and a different muscle, the risorious."
4445,d8ffca6952f2,"But, to an expert faces don't lie; the muscle clues are sometimes used to spot when a smiling politician or celebrity isn't being truthful."
4446,8b0cd38b95d4,"In Conclusion, The Theory of Emotion is about moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions,but it also may help produce them, And empathy may happen at some point of time when we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions."
4447,3f3d79837683,"Nick D'Alto's article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" describes the capabilities of new software called the Facial Action Coding System, and provides a few examples of its possible uses."
4448,3f3d79837683,"In the text, the author states that the technology, which evaluates the movement of facial muscles to determine emotion, could be beneficial in places such as a classroom settting."
4449,cbff9c159f07,Using software such as the Facial Action Coding System could be valuable in a classroom setting as it could improve the quality of learning for students.
4450,578f2dd5b477,The new emotion-reading technology could help in the classroom as it could make sure students stayed engaged in the lesson.
4451,f45e3d75aac0,"Often in school, students become bored easily, due to lack of attention long attention spans, uninteresting lessons, or boring teachers."
4452,f45e3d75aac0,This technology could help eliminate bordom.
4453,f45e3d75aac0,"In the article, Dr. Huang states that ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student... [is] bored"" which would be beneficial, as it ""could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."""
4454,f45e3d75aac0,"This means that this technology could tell if students are bored, and could alert the teacher."
4455,f45e3d75aac0,"If teachers knew when their students were loosing focus and becoming uninterested in the lesson, they could change it to bring students back on focus, which would improve the productivity and use of time in the classroom because teachers would not be wasting time teaching students who are uninterested, and therefore, likely not listening."
4456,f45e3d75aac0,"By eliminating this bordom factor, teachers would be more effective with their teaching time, and students would recieve a better quality of learning."
4457,b480775db20b,The technology could also help improve the quality of students' learning because it can make sure students are not confused
4458,4e38c112905e,"Often, when teachers ask if everyone understands the material, students who do not understand, will be too emabrassed to ask for help, or the teachers, with such a large class, will not notice if one or only a few students are falling behind."
4459,4e38c112905e,"Furthermore, in the article, Dr. Huang states that ""'most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" meaning that most communication is picked up in other ways, such as visually."
4460,4e38c112905e,"Unfortunately, often in a classroom setting, teachers must face away from their students when writing on a white board at the front of the classroom, or in similar situations, which means that without the visual connection, much of the communication between students and teachers is lost."
4461,4e38c112905e,"The new technolgoy could help with this problem, as it could identify students' emotions even when a teacher's back is turned, and thus could alert teachers and help them improve their lessons to fit their students' needs."
4462,4e38c112905e,"It could also help evaluate emotions that teachers do not notice, such as if a student is confused, they may try to hide it."
4463,4e38c112905e,"This new technology could identify these emotions and help the teacher make sure all of their students understand the material, which would lead to an improved quality of teaching and learning."
4464,67edbd940e73,"The quality of learning in a classroom setting could be improved by teachers knowing the emotions of their students, which would make new technology such as the Facial Action Coding System, valuable in a classroom setting."
4465,67edbd940e73,"This technololgy would be beneficial because it could identify whether students are confused or bored, which would make class time more productive and interesting, as well as make sure all students understood the material."
4466,67edbd940e73,"This would improve their quality of learning, and make school more meaningful."
4467,51d1d6ed1e04,The facial action coding system has many promising applications
4468,f2d3f1202be4,", Mona Lisa has 83% of happiness 9% disgust 6% fearful and 2% ssanger."
4469,f2d3f1202be4,"According to some new computer software that can reconize emotion the sofware is the latest innovation from prof. Thomas Huang, of the beckman institute for advanced science at the unversity of amsterdam."
4470,f2d3f1202be4,"The process begins when the computar constructs a 3-D computar model of the face: All 44 mayjor muscles in the model must move like human muscles movement of one or more muscles in the model is called an ""action unit"" then Dr. Huang relies on the work of psychologist, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS."
4471,f2d3f1202be4,"Eckman has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and then associated each with characteristics movements of the facial muscle"
4472,f92c6b8c6dc2,I think i like the new technology that the person invented it can detect your emotins and feelings.
4473,f92c6b8c6dc2,And i doubt others can invent something like that
4474,09c0643706b7,The author believes Venus is a worthy pursuit depite the dangers.
4475,09c0643706b7,There is lots of evidence to support the authors claim.
4476,09c0643706b7,I personally agree with the author that we should look into Venus more.
4477,b2152ab45479,Venus could be suitable for humans
4478,90a146301dfa,"The author shows this by telling ""temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to sea level on Earth."
4479,90a146301dfa,"Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels."
4480,90a146301dfa,"Not easy condiotions but survivalbe for humans."""
4481,90a146301dfa,"Venus can be suitable for humans, it just would be very difficult starting off."
4482,90a146301dfa,Soon enough humans would adapt to the hostile environment of Venus.
4483,422d9853abc9,Venus could have to be humanities future if we keep polluting Earth
4484,875dc520df59,"Venus could be suitable yet harsh, but still needs to be learned about a lot more."
4485,875dc520df59,We still know only the bare minimum of Venus.
4486,fa0669b48ee4,Venus is very hostile
4487,59cce5c60949,Humans would not be able to survive on an atmosphere that is 97 percent carbon dioxide.
4488,59cce5c60949,"It's clouds are highly corrosive with sulfuric acid, and temperatures are averaged over 800 degrees Fahrenheit."
4489,59cce5c60949,It would take a very great amount of effort to make Venus a new home.
4490,59cce5c60949,But if it is studied more we may be able to make it a place to stay.
4491,332b3ccc7e4a,Overrall I think it would be smart to learn more about Venus.
4492,332b3ccc7e4a,It could potentially be a new home.
4493,332b3ccc7e4a,"Venus seems to be almost as promising as Mars does right now, but still we need lots of information."
4494,332b3ccc7e4a,"The author had very good claims, and I agree with them."
4495,332b3ccc7e4a,If we put more into studying Venus I believe it would help humanity.
4496,6a80936725cd,"""All of our development since World War II has been centered on the car, and that will have to change"" (Rosenthal source 1) said Transportation of America official David Goldberg in Elisabeth Rosenthal's article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars."""
4497,6a80936725cd,"With air pollution, smog, and greenhouse gas emissions rising all around the world, officials have announced that cars are to blame."
4498,6a80936725cd,"With this, many are resorting to making changes in their communities by offering alternate means of transportation and bringing homes and stores closer together."
4499,61e918f66cf5,The advantages of limiting car usage
4500,2a4280aea025,"fuel will no longer pollute the air,"
4501,0b07a55dcd22,"alternate transportation is available and cheaper,"
4502,5ccd3465352c,it would enforce goodwill and communionship.
4503,52396aa2e1b1,"With President Obama's issue to decrease the amount of air pollution caused by cars, many have realized that car usage is not as common as it used to be."
4504,52396aa2e1b1,"If the number of cars on the road continues to deplete- ""and many sociologists believe it will-it will have benificial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants"" (Rosenthal source 4) says Rosenthal in her article ""The End of Car Culture."""
4505,52396aa2e1b1,By keeping track and trying to deplete the time you spend driving your car the trend of putting air pollution to an end will increase.
4506,b6259428e70e,"By using alternate means of transportation such as buses, trains, and car pooling services you are saving gas money and supporting community business'."
4507,b6259428e70e,"There is a rise in car pooling that has ""facilitated more flexable commuting arrangements, including the evolution of shared van services for getting to work"" (Rosenthal source 4) says Rosenthal."
4508,b6259428e70e,As these changes manifest many people are chosing not to switch back to driving themselvs.
4509,fe861cb25a03,a benifit of limiting our car usage can be found in the better communionship that will result as cities will make their stores closer together and communities more closley knit.
4510,6d51b08dc06b,"In Bogota, Colombia people are practicing ""car-free days"" and relying solely on public transportation."
4511,6d51b08dc06b,"As this happens author of article ""Care-free day is spinning into a big hit in Bogota,"" Andrew Selsy, says ""parks and sports centers [are] bloom[ing] throughout the city; uneven, pitted sidewalks have been replaced by broad, smooth sidewalks; rush-hour restrictions have dramatically cut traffic; and new restaurants and upscale shopping districts have cropped up"" (Selsky source 3)."
4512,6d51b08dc06b,Other places implementing car-free districts will never hear the roars of engines drowning out the chirping of the birds or childrens laughter.
4513,6d51b08dc06b,"Infact, stores and public transportation is stratigically placed a walking distance away thus promoting social and physical benifits (Rosenthal source 1)."
4514,454035436275,"The advantages of limiting car usage include fuel will no longer pollute the air, alternate transportation is available and cheaper, and it would enforce goodwill and communionship."
4515,454035436275,With greenhouse gasses rapidly circulating and polluting the globe it would be acceptional to decrease this by not driving as often.
4516,454035436275,"Furthermore, by using alternate transportation such as car pooling or taking a bus money is saved on gas and car repairs."
4517,454035436275,"Finally, goodwill and good social habits would increase as towns would become more closley knit as everything would only be a walk away."
4518,454035436275,"With this it we should limit our car usage to ""save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve saftey"" (Rosenthal source 4)."
4519,97f536f9da0f,Summer break is the biggest part of the year that students look forward to.
4520,97f536f9da0f,"Students want to have fun with friends and just relax, however, students are still required to continue learning throughout their break in order to retain information they've learned over the school year."
4521,97f536f9da0f,"Consequently, students are assigned teacher-designed summer projects."
4522,f650ee1df0b1,"Some people may say that teacher-designed summer projects are effective, however, student-designed projects are better"
4523,2eae70655d98,it would be more enjoyable for the students
4524,a76c2d81941a,it will have more diverse topics.
4525,a331f8476891,"First of all, having students design their own projects would be a lot more enjoyable for students because they have the freedom to choose their own topics"
4526,632b0893fce9,.
4527,632b0893fce9,"For example, the famous filmmaker and entrepreneur Walt Disney was not always successful with his work."
4528,632b0893fce9,"At the start of his career he drew little art work pieces for a small local newspaper company, although he wasn't able to profit from his drawings that much, he still loved his job because it was something he wanted and loved to do."
4529,632b0893fce9,It can be seen that people are able to go through tough times if they are able to express themselves freely.
4530,632b0893fce9,Another example would be is when my science class was assigned a group project and students had the freedom to do whatever they wanted to do.
4531,632b0893fce9,"My group decided to do it on climate change, which wasn't very appealing to me at the time, but as I learned and dug in deeper into the topic, I found it more and more interesting which led to me being more educated in climate change and gaining new knowledge made it was more memorable."
4532,632b0893fce9,"This shows that when students have the freedom to choose and design their own projects; it helps students learn something they never knew about, which leads to students being more educated."
4533,5ce7f215919c,"Secondly, letting students design their projects will lead to more diverse topics."
4534,53c524bd2f48,"Students are always taught to follow a rubric which can be stressful; consequently, students are limited when it comes to expressing their thoughts and opinions."
4535,53c524bd2f48,"In fact, during my English class, students were split into groups and we were all assigned the same topic to debate about and we were also assigned which side to take on the topic."
4536,53c524bd2f48,"This lead to students being confused and frustrated because they didn't know what to talk about because they didn't agree with what they were assigned, which lead to the debate being very confusing and vague; students from all groups were stating the same basic reasonings with no interesting details."
4537,53c524bd2f48,It can be seen that it's hard to describe or discuss about certain topics when there's no diversity of thoughts.
4538,53c524bd2f48,"On the other hand, during my history class, the whole class held a debate on a topic where students were given the choice to pick which side they wanted to take."
4539,53c524bd2f48,"As a result, students from both sides were able to share their thoughts and opinions on the topics, which led to students from both sides giving diverse, different, and interesting ideas and students were able to learn from each other."
4540,53c524bd2f48,Every person is different and everyone has different thoughts that people can learn from one another.
4541,5b4d824b9a69,Some say that teacher-designed projects are better because teachers are more experienced and know what's better for the students
4542,b9018fb8ca6e,"however, that reasoning is flawed due to the fact that every student is different and some students need more freedom in education."
4543,8ece97216c1f,"For example, studies have shown that when students are given work that's confusing or not enjoyable; they procrastinate until the due date and the scores and grades are often lower."
4544,8ece97216c1f,"However, when students are given the opportunity to choose their own topics and work on what they want to do, they take more responsibility and complete the task on time with a higher score."
4545,8ece97216c1f,"Teachers being more experienced than students may be true, but giving students a chance and letting them work on their own may show better results."
4546,8ece97216c1f,"Often times, students are too focused on grades and rubrics, which can be stressful and upsetting when they receive a bad grade for their work they thought was good, however, when students follow their own rules and knowledge it'll be more rewarding when they receive a good grade and it'll be easier for students to find what they lack and need to work on, to improve when they receive a bad grade."
4547,387a3399f2ba,"In conclusion, students should have the freedom to choose and design their own summer projects because it'll give the students a chance freely express themselves."
4548,387a3399f2ba,"Students today have a lot of information thrown at them during the school year and having to retain all that information throughout summer is very difficult, but having students forcefully research and learn about a topic they don't like would be very discouraging and not very effective."
4549,387a3399f2ba,"Learning is an important part of life, but students should still have the freedom to research and work on something they want to do."
4550,ffd841c2c220,I agree with the author because it its one of our closest planet and it is most earth- like planet in our solar system
4551,121a7e8aba6c,the autor says venus long ago was most likely covered largely with oceans and could of supported various forms of life.
4552,121a7e8aba6c,if we ceould visit venus we could probably find fossils from there.
4553,43cd212e592c,"NASA is making a silicon carbide that could last for up to three weeks in such conditions that meaans eventually we will be able to visit venus and learn about how the planet turned into gas and NASA is trying to make parts that would be more resistant to venus as it states in the passage."""
4554,43cd212e592c,"we are creating a system of mechanical parts tht could be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."""
4555,a27785fe260c,in conclusion i do not the think the author wants to visit venus because it is way to hot to even try to land there if we did land there you would melt it says in paragraph 3 that the enviorment would crush a Submarine that is accustomed to dive in the deepest parts of our oceans.
4556,a27785fe260c,"venus has erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequrnt lighting strikes to any thing trying to land on its surface."
4557,39e86436357c,In the article the author trlls how a new technolgy called the Facisl Action Coding System that identify human emotions.
4558,39e86436357c,"The software is used to ""calculate emotions""."
4559,39e86436357c,"They can caculate six basic emotions ""happiness, suprise."
4560,39e86436357c,"anger,disgust,fear, and sadness""."
4561,39e86436357c,It can tell all of thoes things by your face movements and how you talk.
4562,39e86436357c,"Anyonw can tell if you are sad and dont want to be bothered so it shows emotion but if you ""put on a happy face"" it could accully make you very happy."
4563,1e7112423399,The tecnology could help the student
4564,2973533c8a72,becuase it tells them whenthey are looking bored or sleepy.
4565,ae7d69e56ff8,"Dr. Huang is predicing that the tecnology could have a ""effective human instructor"
4566,a731f8fa8712,the tecnogly is very smart it could also make computer animated faces more expressive for video games or video surgery
4567,3ebdab1366d4,"In the passage they gave an example of a real face painted of ""Mona Lisa"" becuase in the picture she has a stright face and she shows ""no emotion""."
4568,3ebdab1366d4,But it is also made to put a smile on your face.
4569,3ebdab1366d4,"The computer model of the face technology has to have a 3D face model and has to have ""all 44 muscles in the model must move like human muscles""."
4570,3ebdab1366d4,"Humans ""preform the same impressive calcualtion everday""."
4571,3ebdab1366d4,everybody had diferent facal expressions.
4572,5793f2e8c0b6,In conclusion the use of technology to read the emotional expressions of the students in the classroom is valialbe becuase they all need to know how there emotions are and how they are looking in a classroom or jsut on the daily basic.
4573,5793f2e8c0b6,And they can also see what emotional are meaning at that tiem when they didnt.
4574,5793f2e8c0b6,It aslo tells if someone has a real smile and a fake one.
4575,306637500e67,If i was a NASA scientist discussing the fase with someone who thinks it was created by aliens i would tell them that the face was not mad by aliens
4576,5968b6a70294,because it could of bin made by dust and wind or a deid person from milions of years ago also it can be a rock formed as a face .
4577,6aaa214acb67,"
first i think that the face could of ben made up of dust and wind along time ago"
4578,e3d117056090,"because we do not know what was in mars for a long period of time untill we invented satelights, rocket ships and space shutls next i say it could of also ben a deid person."
4579,e3d117056090,one of the resons i say this is because in space a deid bode can not row or reprodus .
4580,6f8f8754d1e8,last but not lest a rock could of den formed or a medeor crash thes are some of the things why i think it could not be aliens.
4581,ea2a7512ca9d,"The use of the facial software in class rooms could be a vital aspect in stopping and preventing tragedies such as school shootings,bullying,and possibly fights."
4582,3fbb6b2c856f,In todays society is a key element on being able to read people's emotion to be able to determine how to approach the said person.
4583,68f6ea26515a,Many people are able to tell when a peer is angry pr sad but some people just have a blank face.
4584,68f6ea26515a,"The use of the software could help teachers understand their students,which in turn can help elaborate people's triggers and can lead to a better day."
4585,68f6ea26515a,"""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive calculation every day."
4586,68f6ea26515a,"For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."
4587,c4de8a66c46f,"Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, etc"
4588,ea9387df056a,Yet Dr. Huang observes that artists such as da Vinci studied human anatomy to help them paint facial muscles precisely enough to convey specific emotions.
4589,ea9387df056a,His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.
4590,ea9387df056a,"Perhaps Dr. Huangs emotion algorithms are a different sort of Da Vinci Code)"""
4591,ae83940cecf7,"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, Dr. Huang predicts."
4592,ae83940cecf7,"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."
4593,609aa99fae83,The same technology can make computer-animated faces more expressivefor video games or video surgery.
4594,609aa99fae83,"Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication, notes Dr. Huang."
4595,609aa99fae83,"So computers need to understand that, too.Eckman has classified six basic emotionshappiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadnessand then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles."
4596,609aa99fae83,"For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when youre surprised; your orbicularis oris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."
4597,b45b80bf58e9,In conclusion the software should be implemented in todays classrooms .Althoughyour home PC cant handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisas smile.
4598,30f83464433c,The author suggests that studying Venus is worthy enough even though it is very dangerous.
4599,0744c1a2c9a9,"The author mentioned that on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet ."
4600,0744c1a2c9a9,His solution to survive this weather that is dangerous to us humans is to allow them to float above the fray.
4601,0744c1a2c9a9,"A ""blimp-like"" vehicle hovering 30 or so miles would help avoid the unfriendly ground conditions ."
4602,0744c1a2c9a9,"At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth"
4603,9a04040ae994,"So not easy conditions, but survivable enough for humans."
4604,9a04040ae994,So this would help make the mission capeable of completing.
4605,1dfd9652c5bb,He also mentions how peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penertrate the dense atmosphere making it hard to take photographs .
4606,1dfd9652c5bb,"They also cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance"
4607,8d666a29f440,So many reaserchers are working on innovations that would allow their machines to last long enough to help gain some imformation of Venus
4608,b75a2c938d03,They are working on other ways to study Venus
4609,6f99fd417d8c,such as simplified electrnics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface .
4610,6f99fd417d8c,So far they have lasted for 3 weeks in these conditions which is more than enough time hopefully for them to be able to grab enough information.
4611,6f99fd417d8c,Their other project that they are working on is using an old technology called mechanical computers.
4612,6f99fd417d8c,"They are powerful, flexible, and quick."
4613,6f99fd417d8c,"Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"
4614,135516ad705f,He feels that studying Venus even though its dangerous is valuable
4615,53a9ecd03144,"because of the insight they could gain about the planet itself but also becuase ""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."""
4616,54b11a94f284,I think the author supported his claim very well he explained why he thought it as nessary to go even though it is dangerous and he gave solutions to some of the dangers on Venus such as sollution to the heat and ways to actually help gain evicence and imformation on Venus.
4617,fd4532a1ad4e,How would you like to do a boring project on your summer break?
4618,fd4532a1ad4e,"Doesn't sound fun, does it?"
4619,fd4532a1ad4e,Schools believe that during the summer students need to actively learn.
4620,fd4532a1ad4e,They ensure students continue learning by giving them summer projects.
4621,fd4532a1ad4e,The matter at hand is; whether these projects should be teacher-designed or student-designed.
4622,fd4532a1ad4e,"It is the students project, so why shouldn't it be designed by them?"
4623,fd4532a1ad4e,"In most cases, teacher-designed projects are very detailed and include many parts, the teachers expect too much from the students."
4624,fd4532a1ad4e,"A student-designed project can ensure interest in the project, teacher-designed projects become boring and there's a lack of interest."
4625,fd4532a1ad4e,"During summer break many students will go on vacations or visit family,"
4626,913c1b0fc562,having the students design the projects assigned can allow them to take into account the time they have available.
4627,04533a93f27f,Teacher-designed projects are very intricate and the teachers expect too much from the students.
4628,3255996da2e4,Teachers have high standards.
4629,3255996da2e4,High standards can be good during the school year but for a summer project this can become very stressful.
4630,3255996da2e4,"There are a plethora of components to a teacher-designed project, research, citations, outlines, rough drafts, and countless more."
4631,3255996da2e4,These projects force students to push themselves.
4632,276b5e0d57b8,Many might argue that its good for students to push themselves
4633,46c1b77bb57b,but it is summer break after all and students have been pushing themselves for about ten months.
4634,46c1b77bb57b,These students are tired and adding stress to their vacation is cruel.
4635,3a911a26ae33,Doing a project you're uninterested in can be very bland and boring.
4636,3a911a26ae33,Teachers don't think about how uninteresting a topic or project can be to a student.
4637,3a911a26ae33,Not having interest in a topic can be very detrimental to a students grade and the effort they put into the project.
4638,3a911a26ae33,"The same reaction can come from a boring class, students will start to loose focus, dread doing the work, or not put in any effort."
4639,3a911a26ae33,I've personally experienced doing a project I had no interest in.
4640,3a911a26ae33,I subconsciously procrastinated which lead to turning it in very late.
4641,3a911a26ae33,I could not focus on the task and was drowning in work by the time it was due
4642,24dc160584c1,If a student were to designed the project they could choose a topic they were genuinely interested in.
4643,24dc160584c1,This would set them up for success and they could have fun learning something new.
4644,9c945aa7fb39,Summer break is commonly associated with spending time with family and going on vacations.
4645,9c945aa7fb39,This is the case for most students.
4646,9c945aa7fb39,"Giving students a long, details, mandated project is time consuming and takes away from their vacation."
4647,9c945aa7fb39,"As a child of a divorced couple, my summers are filling with traveling to see my dad and spending time with him."
4648,9c945aa7fb39,"I've personally experience having a summer project that I had to take time out of seeing my Father to do, which was upsetting because I only see him once a year."
4649,9c945aa7fb39,It's students like me who would love the chance to design their summer projects.
4650,cccd13ad6989,Given the chance to design their summer project students can ensure for themselves that it will not take away from their own plans and it will encourage them to finish it in a more timely manner.
4651,bfaa493af812,Some schools assign students summer projects to assure they continue to learn during their vacation.
4652,bfaa493af812,These projects should be designed by the students.
4653,bfaa493af812,The projects should be student-designed because teachers have high standards.
4654,bfaa493af812,Due to these high standards their projects require students to push themselves when all year that what they've been doing.
4655,bfaa493af812,Lack of interest plays a huge role in many teacher's projects.
4656,bfaa493af812,Teachers aren't doing their best to assure that their projects spark some aspect of interest in their students.
4657,bfaa493af812,Having no interest in a project can cause the student to procrastinate and not do their best.
4658,bfaa493af812,"Lastly, students have complicated schedules in the summer, many go away on vacation or spend time with family."
4659,bfaa493af812,Having a teacher designed-project that's time consuming can take away from their valuable time.
4660,bfaa493af812,Letting students design the project can ensure they will have enough time to work on it and will encourage them to finish it earlier.
4661,bfaa493af812,"Student-designed projects can benefit the student immensely in multiple ways, where as a teacher-designed project will let them down and cause unnecessary stress."
4662,a2225a4bfcd3,"In 2006 a trend began to grow in Europe, United States, and other places around the world to seporate auto use and the suburban life in to a movement called ""smart planning."""
4663,a2225a4bfcd3,Most of the greenhouse gases emissions are up too 12 percent and is climing to greater than 50 percent in the United States and in Europe.
4664,a2225a4bfcd3,Most of our development after World War II has be n centered  on the car or other means of transport.
4665,a2225a4bfcd3,80 percoent of laws have to highways and only 20 percent to other transport in the United States.

4671,a2225a4bfcd3,For the third stright year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis alound to dive during the day in countries around the world to reduce smog and greenhouse effects that happen.
4672,a2225a4bfcd3,which if you think about the ideas that ae being share around the world with other countries the world is be comung less likely to be effected by the grren huse effects around the world.
4673,d43c387afa7d,Do you remember the space trip to Mars?
4674,d43c387afa7d,"Well, another debate is brewing: Should we go to Venus or not?"
4675,d43c387afa7d,There are two perspectives on this issue.
4676,d43c387afa7d,"They are the people that want travel Venus (the author), and the people that don't want travel to Venus."
4677,d43c387afa7d,There are two inherant issues too.
4678,d43c387afa7d,"They are the need for futher space exploration, and safety"
4679,daa9e265c16b,"The author has provided enough information on both sides of the argument, but he thinks that studying Venus is a ""worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."""
4680,a18a11cd7175,"The people wanting to travel to space believe that we need to go to Venus because it is the planet closest to Earth, in characteristics and in distance."
4681,fa905b24ef6f,"There have been attempts to go the Venus, but everytime the spaceship lands it only survives for a few hours"
4682,bbfe3ab41560,They believe that we need to get up on Venus and study it.
4683,bbfe3ab41560,"There is only so much we can do from Earth, and right now it's not enough."
4684,03ab9332ffd1,The author has a lot of evidence supporting the need for space exploration
4685,a87d6087b8a5,"such as ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."""
4686,b9704692570c,The author beleive that all of the risks he list in the article doesn't matter becayse we need to take risks sometimes.
4687,12da02571846,"The first inherant issue, according to people who don't want to explore Venus, is also a vital part of the arguement."
4688,12da02571846,"They believe that we have already tried going to Venus, it failed, and why try again."
4689,12da02571846,"They believe that we have enough information from what we can do on Earth, why do we need to know everything in the universe?"
4690,12da02571846,They believe that we have already found enough information that we need to know.
4691,6a5856db62db,The second issue is safety.
4692,6a5856db62db,"According to NASA, they have a solution for getting a spaceship to Venus carefully and safely."
4693,6a5856db62db,"""Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."
4694,6a5856db62db,"Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way."
4695,6a5856db62db,"At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth."
4696,6a5856db62db,"Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels."
4697,6a5856db62db,"Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."""
4698,6a5856db62db,(paragraph 5).
4699,6a5856db62db,NASA has a soultion for the safety issue that was recently brought to their attention.
4700,6a5856db62db,The people who want to go and explore Venus now believe that this is one of the final steps toward actually getting off of the ground.
4701,6a5856db62db,"If NASA trains astronauts well enough, tries to simulate the conditions on Venus, and everything works well; there is noting holding them back."
4702,7fe41fb45edf,The author expresses his support for the innovation NASA invented.
4703,7fe41fb45edf,The author thinks that this the object of the future.
4704,4e7dae2acc8c,"The second issue, according to the people who want to stay grounded on Earth, is important for both sides to recognize."
4705,4e7dae2acc8c,The people in the second perspective say it is not safe to go to Venus.
4706,4e7dae2acc8c,"We have tried it unmanned, and the unmanned spaceship counldn't live there for longer than a few hours, so it is too dangerous."
4707,4e7dae2acc8c,"""On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."
4708,4e7dae2acc8c,"These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth..."" (Paragraph 3)."
4709,4e7dae2acc8c,This quote helps support the second perspective for wanting NASA to kept its space ships from going to Venus.
4710,4e7dae2acc8c,"As the quote says, Venus is a very dangerous planet."
4711,e9bdb6ade89f,"In conclusion, the arguement is still ongoing, and doesn't seem to have a clear answer."
4712,e9bdb6ade89f,"I believe the stasis lies between finding a need for going to Venus, that isn't just the need for exploration, and a proven safe way to get and stay on Venus."
4713,e9bdb6ade89f,The two perspectives are the author and the people opposing the author.
4714,e9bdb6ade89f,The two issues are is there a need for exploaration and the safety of going to Venus.
4715,e9bdb6ade89f,"Therefore, with all the evidence provided to you, you can make a clear decision about if you want NASA going to Venus, or if you want NASA to stay grounded, but the author believes that you should side with him in support of Venus exploration."
4716,bf6383985100,Summer break can lead to a fallback in students' learning from the previous year.
4717,bf6383985100,"In order to combat this problem, many schools have projects for the students over summer break to ensure that students maintain the skills that they learned in school."
4718,bf6383985100,"Some of these projects might require a lot of work, while others are less labor intensive."
4719,bf6383985100,"However, one thing is true for all of these projects."
4720,3abe170d29e6,They should be student designed
4721,5d945570740a,because this insures that the students will be engaged with the project
4722,15e1d321ed87,", gives teachers a better understanding of what students are passionate about,"
4723,f3b0379d85f5,is the most fair way to give students work over a break.
4724,b4dd1ae129e4,Having students design their own projects will ensure that the project is something that the students actually enjoy doing.
4725,ee184f2c93e6,"Firstly, because they have choice in what they do, the students will be able to pick a subject or manner of presentation that they are excited about."
4726,ee184f2c93e6,"If the teacher were to assign the same project to every student without allowing the students to have any say in what they actually end up doing, there would defiantly be students who are not interested in the project."
4727,ee184f2c93e6,"Secondly, the students will also understand the project better."
4728,ee184f2c93e6,"The students will have designed their own project, so they will know exactly what the outcome is supposed to be like and how to get there."
4729,ee184f2c93e6,"Many projects are hard for students because they are not actually aware of what they are intended to do, so by allowing the students to design their own project, the school ensures that the students will completely comprehend it."
4730,ee184f2c93e6,"Lastly, having the project be designed by students means that the students will be given more opportunity for creativity."
4731,ee184f2c93e6,"Because the students more liberty over their project, they will be able to use more of their own unique ideas in the project."
4732,268726cf4369,"
Allowing students to design their own project is also better for the teachers"
4733,a013f1579dba,"First of all, the teachers responsible for grading the project will be given an opportunity to better understand their students before the school year ever starts."
4734,a013f1579dba,This understanding is because students are allowed to express themselves more through a project they designed themselves.
4735,a013f1579dba,"Secondly, the teachers will not have to worry about making different projects for different levels of students, or about having to make a project that will interest many different types of students because the students will be responsible for making the project work for their level of understanding and interests."
4736,a013f1579dba,"Lastly, the teachers will be provided a time to learn things that they would not have a chance to learn otherwise."
4737,a013f1579dba,"This is because the students are given the opportunity for creativity, so they may choose to do a project about something that a teacher may have know previous knowledge of."
4738,835573461b6a,Allowing students to design their own summer projects is a more fair way to assign work over the summer holiday.
4739,d6c22de61d93,"To begin, the students have been completing teacher designed work all school year, so it is only fair to give the students a break and allow them to design their own projects."
4740,d6c22de61d93,"Additionally, the projects are assigned as work over the summer, so they should not feel like the same work that students are being assigned all year long."
4741,d6c22de61d93,Because the students have been working very diligently over the year to complete many different types of assignments from teachers.
4742,d6c22de61d93,It would not be fair to the students to essentially continue that trend of assignments into the vacation.
4743,d6c22de61d93,"Finally, a student designed projects allows for more flexibility."
4744,d6c22de61d93,This flexibility allows the students the opportunity to create a project that will be conducive to a busy summer schedule.
4745,d6c22de61d93,"Many students have to travel or go to summer camps, so they mightn not be able to complete to work which a teacher who does not know the summer plans of a students designs."
4746,d6c22de61d93,"However, it the student designs their own project, they will be able to make it work with their summer schedule."
4747,9d09d77c3ac3,"If a school assigns a summer project to their students, the project should be student designed."
4748,9d09d77c3ac3,"there re many different ways to continue learning when formal school is on a break, but a student designed project will allow for creativity, flexibility, and be better for teachers as well as students."
4749,9d09d77c3ac3,"Above all, schools should focus on educating students in a way that allows them creating and ensure that they are passionate about what they learn, if not students will never develop a life long love of education."
4750,acac2f0c3afc,The author supports the idea of studying Venus in a descriptive way.
4751,acac2f0c3afc,Have you ever wanted to or at least have learned about the other planets in our solar system?
4752,acac2f0c3afc,Do you know what Venus is?
4753,acac2f0c3afc,In my opinion I believe that learning more about another planet like Venus is worth knowing about.
4754,eaefb96a3479,"he's giving us details about our focus, Venus."
4755,ae75316662c6,He explains that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any other planet in the solar system even though the one planet being close to the sun is Mercury.
4756,ae75316662c6,This is something unique to say about Venus.
4757,a67555785863,the author supports the idea of studying Venus despite the dangers of it because he's being descriptive about Venus and explains more details about it.
4758,797a1de01456,"he says,"" Also notable, Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in the solar system."""
4759,ed1f18bfdf66,This is something interesting to learn about Venus and thats how well the author supports the idea of studying Venus.
4760,092b883ee764,"Nine out of ten students always say that most projects should be based on what they want to do, so it is not as dull as doing a teacher assigned on a specific topic."
4761,fb909fd4fe66,Teachers do have some great ideas when it comes down to projects but some students can show more creativity when they can decide on the project they want to work on.
4762,137d32b94713,Students also can learn more from a topic they chose for the project for that particular class because they go out to find more information about the topic they think they might enjoy.
4763,248993ac2f7c,Summer projects should be student-designed
4764,34831ae940c9,it shows more creativity
4765,944c88d3db61,"it shows their learning abilities,"
4766,4aab8f6417eb,it allows the student to pace themselves.
4767,9ab44e228839,When a teacher assigns a project their are usually some type of regulations they must follow for the project and you are only allowed to talk about specific topics.
4768,9ab44e228839,This for students does not allow for creativity because they will only follow what the teacher's checklists has so they can get the best grade possible.
4769,2ad08a7d78f9,"While yes, teachers usually assign projects so a student does not go off topic,"
4770,92bbe1cbe8f4,but this can be easily fixed by simply showing some topics they can use but not forcing the topics on the students to use it and also allow students to find something about that topic or something that can relate to that topic.
4771,d654ce27e576,Student-designed projects allows the students to make the most effort out of the topic they chose because the student shows that is the topic the student wants to talk about
4772,f5dd68f6ea4e,it is like a sport most professional sports player do not play a sport they do not like.
4773,f5dd68f6ea4e,Players play a sport where the player can see the most effort from themselves or which sport allows the player to show the most creativity in that sport.
4774,f5dd68f6ea4e,Like Messi named as the best soccer player in the world because of his creativity with the ball and all the effort that is put into every game.
4775,cb392c230688,When it comes down to projects the teacher is always looking for what they learn from a project that student worked on but most students do not really learn well about the topic because the student did not want to learn about that topic it was given to them by the teacher.
4776,cb392c230688,"So, they will go on to just read something the student finds online and just copies most of the information about what that student read and make something similar."
4777,cb392c230688,When a student is allowed to pick a topic they have to find information about that topic and will try harder to make it one of their better projects for themselves.
4778,25212280c666,"While yes, the student can use online sources and copy information from that source"
4779,75d769995790,they will try harder to explain it in their own words because that is the top the student wanted to talk about and wants to make an effort to show what they are capable of doing when the student is allowed to pick an idea for their own project.
4780,b697421976bc,During a project a lot of planning ahead must come to mind the student will have to rush the projects as they would if it had deadlines for each couple of weeks.
4781,b697421976bc,This allows the student to pace themselves and not feel that their project was rushed and they are not just putting all the work in one day.
4782,82bdffce496e,most students during projects tend to feel rushed because they feel they are not given enough time to do it while yes most students could still possibly finish the project last minute the overall feeling of planning ahead can help them to show hoe much work they put into the project everyday.
4783,82bdffce496e,A student tends to be a big procrastinator so when they pace themselves it allows the student to see if they can take a break for a day or not.
4784,82bdffce496e,When we look at adult projects they prepared to explain the topic because they plan accordingly and they pace themselves so they are not stressing out too much for their project.
4785,6369e7e42d2f,"While yes, a teacher-designed project may be good for a student, a student-designed project is much better because it can show people great creativity, it allows a student to learn better, and it allows the student to better prepare themselves."
4786,6369e7e42d2f,Most students tend to see that their designs help them more because it shows they put more effort into their projects to allow a teacher to see where they are at.
4787,1fbc9f7ccd5d,"The average person uses their phone many times a day whether it be consciously or not, we as a people always have access to our own devices."
4788,1fbc9f7ccd5d,The problem with people using their phone is when to use it and how to use it properly.
4789,1fbc9f7ccd5d,When inside of a vehicle there should only be a bare minimum of use to your phone.
4790,1fbc9f7ccd5d,Whether that reason would be an emergency call or even doing simple things like using the maps application.
4791,87ef57ac2ec1,"All in all, humans as a whole should be able to use their phones but only to an extent."
4792,52c993214c35,"The use of a phone in a car could be proven to be fatal but there are good reasons to use said phone, only in certain situations."
4793,4a6c0cc55ed5,One of the reasons would be that to use your phone to get your way through areas you have no idea how to get through or using your phone to find your way home from a place you have no knowledge on.
4794,4a6c0cc55ed5,The downside is that when the person glances at the phone to see where to turn or make a specific move they lose the focus on the road for a split second which could be fatal.
4795,4a6c0cc55ed5,Sometimes the use of a phone all depends on what kind of person it is.
4796,688e763ef9fb,The person themselves also plays a big role in the use of cellphones in the car.
4797,04ba4fb54840,"The person could be a maniac when it comes down to how they use their phone, some people can't even live without it because they are so connected to it, for those specific people who have those kinds of issues when it comes down using their phones they should not be able to use their phone at all because they would then get distracted by the other uses."
4798,04ba4fb54840,The amount of sheer will they would need to not get distracted by those other things would be entirely on them but in the mean time they should have no reason to use their phone.
4799,375dab1a0328,Phones play a big role in people's lives and it even saves them sometimes but the use of a phone is dangerous when the person is distracted on their phone
4800,e2d15ddcedad,A second could save them from a life threatening accident.
4801,e2d15ddcedad,The amount of people that are in car accidents that involve phones is 26% in 2014.
4802,e2d15ddcedad,When the person is using their phone they are putting themselves and other people at risk on the road.
4803,e2d15ddcedad,"According to the National Safety Council, the use of cell phones when driving leads to 1.6 million crashes annually."
4804,f90c6f57d1a4,Texting while driving would be the biggest issue when it comes down to the use of a cell phone.
4805,1f4725707346,"According to the NHTSA, driving while texting is six times more dangerous than driving drunk."
4806,1f4725707346,"Also texting while driving is now the lead cause of teen deaths in the USA, more than 3000 teens die each year alone as a result of sending a test message to somebody while they are in the use of a car."
4807,bb0209e82447,"The amount of consequences for just the use of a phone is just not enough, is the phone as important as the person's life?"
4808,bb0209e82447,It should never come down to that question because your life is way more valuable than sending a text to someone while driving.
4809,a0fffd4654e0,I claim for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions.
4810,be1a8fa18ccf,"one it carries code to help it detect certan emotions in the human face,"
4811,f4d983d3bb11,"according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emostions, but also may even help produce them."
4812,c6e9d448e6ac,One it carries code to help it detect certan emotions in the human face
4813,480f3af222f6,"Also the code can be kept for years, and would only need to to updated so we won't need to have multiple people tring to tell others how their facial expressions tells hows they are feeling."
4814,660173660df8,"Two according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emostions, but also may even help produce them"
4815,37dd05bef5e9,"A esample of this would be the classic of ""put a smile on your face""."
4816,82bd3bd3ba44,"In conclusion, I claim for the value of using this technology to read students' emotional expressions."
4817,82bd3bd3ba44,"To support the claim here's to esamples, one it carries code to help it detect certan emotions in the human face, and two according to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emostions, but also may even help produce them."
4818,6025065dd80e,"In today's world, students are filled with many emotions, some too difficult for even parents to decode."
4819,6025065dd80e,The rollercoaster of feelings that a teenager endures in a day is confusing and complex.
4820,6025065dd80e,"But with newly found technology, it may be easier now for the emotions of students' to be understood and assisted, if needed."
4821,6025065dd80e,"The revolutionary Facial Action Coding System allows computers to scan and analyze the feelings of a human, alive or painted, and is a very valuable tool to comprehend student's emotional expressions."
4822,56cdbb222ec0,This highly advanced technology is able to serve a multitiude of purposes that will foster an improved learning environment for students.
4823,83215bd953bc,"Because of this new and itelligent technology, doctors and others are able to read emotions of people in a way never previously possible."
4824,83215bd953bc,"This brilliant computer ""constructs a 3-D computer model of the face"" (3)."
4825,83215bd953bc,including all major muscles.
4826,83215bd953bc,"With the ability to do so, this computer scans and creates a human face and, based on the position of the muscles, is able to determine the distribution of emotions felt at that moment by a person."
4827,83215bd953bc,"Tested with the Mona Lisa, this model ""can even identify mixed emotions (as in da Vinci's masterpiece)."
4828,83215bd953bc,"Each expression is compared against a neutral face"" (4)."
4829,83215bd953bc,"By comparing the chosen face against an emotionless one, this advanced techonology allows the ability to use muscle positions to analyze the feelings of a person"
4830,cee87ecf467a,"The ingenuity of the computers provide the resources and ability to decode complex human emotions and, in turn, will be able to be utilized in methods that will add to the betterment of society."
4831,1bb4b9c4e28a,The Facial Action Coding System will foster a more positive learning environment for students by adapting their online experience to their emotions.
4832,e7b0167a7e4e,"If implemented in daily computers, this technology will revolutionize the environemnt and usage of the Internet."
4833,e7b0167a7e4e,"Because this technology can map emotions, ""if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow."
4834,e7b0167a7e4e,"But if you frown, the next ad will be different"" (6)."
4835,e7b0167a7e4e,"With the implementation of this technology, students will be able to influence which advertisements and pages appear on their screen."
4836,e7b0167a7e4e,"This will reduce their impatience on the computer, and actually stay focused on the task at hand, rather than getting frustrated and walking away."
4837,2746f1781a6f,"With the ability to control the pages on their computer screen, students will feel empowered and influential, giving them confidence and increasing their work ethic."
4838,0619ea66dd87,"With an increased work ethic, students will remain productive and efficient with their time and materials."
4839,0619ea66dd87,The content of the student's lesson can also be adapted based on their emotional behavior.
4840,0619ea66dd87,"Dr Huang, the innovator of this technology, describes that at school, ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored...Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor"""
4841,0c483c8cd2dd,"By allowing the computer to customize the lesson, students will stay more engaged, as the content they are learning is one that they enjoy."
4842,2f684eaaae15,Students will find pleasure in learning the subjects that interest them while also learning about other less-interesting subjects in a more captivating manner.
4843,2f684eaaae15,"The innovative technology serves to better a student's learning environment, keeping them engaged and interested in the content."
4844,2f684eaaae15,Schools will notice increased success rates and knowledgable students.
4845,2f684eaaae15,"By providing students with the chance to customize the method in which they learn, school will be more enjoyable and students will stay committed to their education."
4846,2f684eaaae15,The emotion-analyzing software gives students this chance and will greatly impact the way they learn and the committment to their education.
4847,054b206cdf88,"The highly inteliigent Facial Action Coding System a valuable asset for students in a classroom, as it fosters an enjoyable and captivating learning environment that will shape the students' commitment to school."
4848,054b206cdf88,"This advanced software analyzes the movement of a human's facial muscles, comparing it to an emotionless one, and determines the percent distribution their feelings."
4849,054b206cdf88,"This innovative software provides students with the ability to customize the pages and lessons on the computer, giving them control over their method of learning."
4850,054b206cdf88,"Students with this ability will feel captivated by their learning, as they are in control and can decide how they learn."
4851,054b206cdf88,"The development of a desire to learn is crucial for school-aged children so that in the future, they will continue on to further educate themselves and expand their knowledge."
4852,054b206cdf88,"This facial

-analysis technology provides schools with the ability to create a captivating learning environment for students that will motivate them to stay committed to their education and reach their goals."
4853,054b206cdf88,"While this new technology provides a bounty of benefits to many, assisting students in the achievement of their hopes and dreams holds the most value."
4854,a751f6cecb8c,"It would be awsome to identify human emotions,and knowing what students feel in class can be really useful."
4855,11e017aceee2,I think the new technology that reads emotional expressions of people can be useful in schools.
4856,8407f0affac7,"The teachers will be able to know when the students are bored, in the article it said ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."""
4857,8407f0affac7,it let's the teacher know by the students emotions that the lesson is boring or the lesson is not understandable for them.
4858,8407f0affac7,"The new technology can help teachers make their plan lessons more fun and understandable and if the schools of all around the world uses the new technology it would be lot easier for the teachers to make the students be more focus on school and the lesson,"
4859,ae61c64c3a04,"not only the technology can help schools it can also help people with their business,"
4860,11861fcd156e,but that's not the point
4861,e7e1ac42877d,the point is that school's should start using the new the technology to help students stay in school and helped them to stay focus.
4862,3d58e375b96b,But not only it helps during class time it can also help outside of school
4863,59d7412ae009,"if the student's play sports the coches can know when the student is sad, tired, happy,or angry."
4864,8b9eacc8e394,So I think having the new technology in school can be really helpful and useful for everyone but most likely the teacher's.
4865,d1a64f0eedec,In this short story the authoer is sayiing thet it is not woth you time to study venus.
4866,d1a64f0eedec,it not with the time but it is a star that shines bright inthe sky at nigh time
4867,83ced09922b9,"The author said ""the value of returning to venus seems indisputable, but what are the opitions for making such a mission both safe and scientifically productive""."
4868,83ced09922b9,it not safe to send to someone int to space to venus becasue they do not know if they will be able to get them back to earth safely.
4869,83ced09922b9,"for other reason, "" NASA's possible solution to the hostile condititons on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the roiling venusian landscape."
4870,83ced09922b9,"with means that venus landscape it not good for people to be up ther on it surface, scientist do jnot know if there is right oxygen on that planet for humans to breath."
4871,83ced09922b9,"With that

""NASA is working on other approaches to study venus"", because they are now thinking that it not safe for them to send humans upp to space to get data for them because they don't know what it like on that planet or how the weather , the surface is for humans to be on it."
4872,83ced09922b9,"NASA is goimg to be useing technology with they call "" mechanical computers"" to studdy the planet here on earth."
4873,83ced09922b9,"but venus is now called"" the evening star brightest points of light in the night sky""."

4916,9e398dea1657,Venus is the second planet in the solar system from the sun that precedes Earth in the planetary order.
4917,9e398dea1657,"This planet is often called Earth's ""twin"" and the ""Evening Star"" of the universe because of its brightness and relative similarity to the Earth."
4918,9e398dea1657,"In the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author presents facts and figures that one could use to determine whether studying Venus would be an advantageous pursuit even though it would not be very safe."
4919,9e398dea1657,"The author focuses more on the drawbacks of exploring Venus, hence the title of this work."
4920,8b543ad23fbe,The author does not strongly support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit due to his extensive reasearch on its toxic living conditions but does acknowledge the benefits of its accessibility from Earth.
4921,aae9ec3d1111,"Compared to Earth, the author has found that Venus in less less survivable for humans."
4922,924bf72d3f77,"In the early years of space industry, numerous spacecraft have embarked on missions to the planet, but they were not able to return home."
4923,924bf72d3f77,"Unlike Earth, Venus has an atmosphere that is ""almost 97percent carbon dioxide"" with a surface temperature averaging ""over 800 degrees Fahrenheit"" and an ""atmospheric pressure [that] is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet""(Paragraph 3)."
4924,924bf72d3f77,"Due to these extreme differences in temperature, pressure, and air content, Venus would be fairly inhospitable for humans."
4925,924bf72d3f77,Usually when NASA launches missions to other planets they are trying to find alternatives habitats for the human race in the event that they cannot survive on Earth.
4926,924bf72d3f77,"If humans will not be able to withstand the conditions of Venus it is no longer a good option; therefore, it is not worth looking into since the author provides evidence that Venus would not be a useful living environment in the future."
4927,062afcc938ba,"However, the author has also found that studying Venus could be beneficial considering its proximity and similar geographical features to Earth."
4928,93bca4d6e6be,"The Earth comes right after Venus in the solar system, making it fairly close given the long time frame of space travel."
4929,93bca4d6e6be,"Astronomers have discovered that it was also previoulsly one of the ""most Earth-like [planets]"" as it ""was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"" (Paragraph 4)."
4930,93bca4d6e6be,"Venus also ""has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"" (Paragraph 4)."
4931,93bca4d6e6be,"In the event that Venus became a viable option for humans to inhabit when Earth collapses (as mentioned earlier), humans would have already been exposed to some of the landscape there."
4932,93bca4d6e6be,"Although this would make Venus more assimilable, its similarity to Earth does not outweigh the dangers that still come with the planet being an unknown land changing from its previous state."
4933,93bca4d6e6be,"With this evidence the author provides an advantage to exploring Venus, but it does not hold up against the established points about Venus' overall uninhabitability."
4934,370578bd0c97,"Throughtout the article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author presents infomation for exploring Venus being both beneficial and harmful,"
4935,aa19f6a313f5,but he elaborates more on the reasons pointing to the dangers that Venus poses.
4936,4b0c17c52cbd,"Compared to current conditions of Earth, Venus does not possess the necessary qualities that would make it a valuable reserve for potentially sustaining human life forms."
4937,04f6724f9528,The author is better able to address the disadvantages of studying Venus because of the extensive research revealing the planet's present volatile state instead of benefits from its similarity to Earth.
4938,04f6724f9528,"Therefore, the author fails to thoroughly prove Venus' worthiness of exploration."
4939,aacb4731e3f5,This storie is about the challeng of exploring Venus.
4940,aacb4731e3f5,The auhor talked how venus is closest planet in earth
4941,a030392f3a0e,The author support the idea by showing us how studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.
4942,a6c66acec872,in the story the author talked about how studying venus is worthy.
4943,82a62866a858,"In the story the said ""venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our scholar system."
4944,82a62866a858,"The value of returning to venus seems indisputable, but what are the options for making such a mission both safe scientifically productive."
4945,82a62866a858,This quotes revals that venus is worthy because people use for a lot things such as going to missions.
4946,660b5b8f1d4a,In the article the author taked about how venus is pursuit.
4947,e1709a2b79f8,in the article the the author said NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions o the surface of venus would allow scientitis to float above the fray.
4948,e1709a2b79f8,Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape.
4949,e1709a2b79f8,Ths quotes means thta venus is pursuit because is halping people wiht the electronic such as vehicule.
4950,dd3d3c367626,In the story the author talked abouth how Venus is despite in danger.
4951,3b95a318f181,"In the storis the author said"" Beyond high presure and heat, venusian geogoly and weather presentadditional impedimants like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lihgtning strikes to probes seeking to lead on its surface."
4952,3b95a318f181,"By comparing, system that use mechenical parts can be made more resistant to pressure,heat,and other foces""."
4953,3b95a318f181,This quotes mean that Venus is despite in danger because it barley causes dager like other planet.
4954,08d603837de9,the author support the idea by showing us how Venus is a worthy pursuit despite in danger.
4955,08d603837de9,In this storie the author talked how venus plante is different from the other planet in the earth surface.
4956,08d603837de9,The author also talked about hoe Venus don't cause volcanoes and earthquakes.
4957,c5231cde0a1d,I disagree with the value of using this technology to read students emotional expression
4958,0c039d074903,a picture may be susposed to make you laugh but it only shows what the computer can do.
4959,77140ceb1f4d,Only you know how you are feeling inside and whenever somebody says that they use technology to read students emotional expressions they are not accurate .
4960,ec46a6da0a83,The Mona Lisa picture is intended to make somebody smile but it only shows what the computer can do
4961,54190debdfe0,The creater of the picture has made more than one picture .
4962,54190debdfe0,You may not see anything in the picture that shows emotion but there is always something in his paintings .
4963,54190debdfe0,"The Mona Lisa picture is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted , 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry ."
4964,54190debdfe0,She has many emotions not just one
4965,7f719c487d56,Even thought you may think the Mona Lisa may be boring it does show emotion but it is hard to find .
4966,7f719c487d56,New computer software has been made to inhance the picture .
4967,e877f27f6396,Ill be sumerizing the article over venus and why it is not we can not step foot on this planet.
4968,6a3c46bc327f,It says in paragraph two that venus is drapped in clouds and that the un manned ships that have been send did not last more that 2 hours.
4969,863b761e3ac4,That is whay no man has ever steped foot on Venus.
4970,410b2283fa79,Venus is a chellenging planet the last time a space craft touched down was 3 decades.
4971,410b2283fa79,"Beyond high pressureand heat, eupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikesto probes seeking to land on its surface."
4972,49cbd709df6c,If Venus is so inhospitable why are scientists even discussing visits to its surface.
4973,49cbd709df6c,Astronomers are fasinated by Venus because it may have been much like earth long ago.
4974,49cbd709df6c,"The planet has a surface of rocky sediments and includes familiar features such as vallies, mountains, and craters."
4975,49cbd709df6c,"Striving to meet the challenge presented by venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the the planet itself."
4976,49cbd709df6c,also because human curiosity will likelylead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.
4977,49cbd709df6c,Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.
4978,1b078b166355,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break, but are unsure whether these tasks should be student-designed or teacher-designed."
4979,1b078b166355,"Psychologists have proven that in order for a person to actually remember information, that information needs to be repeatedly tested upon in order to remain significant in the brain."
4980,1b078b166355,"Summer break, as a huge gap in between learning periods, is massively disruptive to the cognitive process"
4981,d30138609ccd,Summer projects given over the break period should be moderately designed by the students themselves
4982,107277c83a4e,it gives the student control over their individual situation
4983,e39c1041de0c,it allows the student to express themselves creatively
4984,7c98ef2c0f79,it removes pressure from school teachers; all while preparing them for life after school.
4985,d2cb5cddd1e9,"Students in school are constantly coddled, both by their parents and by the teachers in their learning environment."
4986,d2cb5cddd1e9,Giving an individual the ability to plan and create their own project is teaching them how to manage tasks on their own
4987,0d0d04728dce,"It allows them to take into account their schedule, their own situation."
4988,0d0d04728dce,Teenagers in high school spread rapidly after the school season has ended.
4989,0d0d04728dce,"Some travel, or get jobs, or go to summer camps; while others prefer to stay rooted where they are comfortably."
4990,0d0d04728dce,Giving students that ability to decide for themselves how they are going to carry through with working around those activities is necessity.
4991,0d0d04728dce,It allows them room to breathe.
4992,0d0d04728dce,Putting the responsibility of caring for their own needs in students' hands gives them the much-needed abilities they will need for later in life.
4993,32a27405f8f7,Teenagers during the school year often don't get the opportunity to express themselves creatively and individually.
4994,32a27405f8f7,"Tasks designed during this time are teacher-designed and often follow a strict to-do list, which mushes everyone's work into one giant puddle of the same idea"
4995,9887b2cfc1a3,Giving students the thumbs-up to style and create their own work assignment suddenly sets the bar way higher.
4996,9fec48e0ea5a,"Students are much more likely to branch out from the boring, black and white school project normally set by teachers."
4997,9fec48e0ea5a,Difference in thought is an important concept that needs to be stressed to young people in society.
4998,9fec48e0ea5a,No person is the same as any other.
4999,9fec48e0ea5a,Setting an individual up for normality is setting them up for failure in the real world.
5000,fc10519ebbee,Being constantly ailed with stress and work is definitely not beneficial for a persons' health.
5001,fc10519ebbee,"Teachers especially, who work in an environment surrounded by teen drama and the potential spread of sickness, need time off to recover."
5002,fc10519ebbee,"Forcing them to plan and grade massive projects during their supposed ""time off"" is unfair to them."
5003,fc10519ebbee,"During the school year, teachers often have no time to waste to spend with their own children, because they are so focused on having to grade those two-hundred papers for school."
5004,fc10519ebbee,Giving teachers time away from the stress of other peoples' children gives them time to set aside for themselves and for their kids.
5005,2d219bab80f8,"Some people may claim that giving students the ability to design their own project is not ""giving"" but ""forcing""."
5006,2d219bab80f8,Students may need guidelines in order to work properly and receive a fair grade for their effort.
5007,2d219bab80f8,"Or worst case, they simply won't do the work."
5008,2d219bab80f8,"If a student needs a step-by-step process on how to recount their learning, then how will they expect to fend for themselves once they graduate?"
5009,c43b80ff91eb,"During high school, students need this time to learn more than just history or math, they need to learn how to manage their own lives."
5010,c43b80ff91eb,Giving them the right to design their own project is the best decision for both students and teachers.
5011,bc49340ab6d7,"As the school year comes to an end, the school halls are filled with students' conversing about their summer plans, an the joys of the school year being over."
5012,bc49340ab6d7,"However, for many students, school isn't nearly over."
5013,bc49340ab6d7,Some schools task their students with summer projects to ensure that students keep learning outside of the school year.
5014,bc49340ab6d7,"Ultimately, it is questioned whether the project should be teacher-designed, or student-designed"
5015,744a2452910a,"When a student is given the power to design their own project, it allows the student to grow mentally and help broaden their learning horizons."
5016,17d7cd64a3ba,"This allows students to base their project on something that they are heavily interested in,"
5017,da1c2ec712e3,others might even venture beyond what they are already familiar with
5018,87f8ba671de4,it motivates them to complete their assignment with passion.
5019,f39a4a234fc3,"It is very often that when a student is told they must complete a project based off a topic that they aren't interested in, their initial thought may be that the project will be boring and difficult."
5020,f39a4a234fc3,"However, when they are allowed to chose their topic, it is very likely that their perspective might change into a more positive point of view."
5021,362001f8a244,students might try and explore other topics in which they lack knowledge
5022,5ff9af4bd5f7,"By learning about different subjects, one is able to broaden their educational horizons, which may come in handy later on in life."
5023,5ff9af4bd5f7,"I once new a woman who arrived at college ""undecided""."
5024,5ff9af4bd5f7,"She was unsure of what to major in, and she was later told that she needed to complete a project in a subject of her choosing by the end of the year."
5025,5ff9af4bd5f7,"Soon after the news, she realized that she needed to decide on a project fast, so she decided she would join her parish during one of their visits to a poor community out of town."
5026,5ff9af4bd5f7,"She had no knowledge of how to help the people in the community, but she believed that she would be able to both accomplish her project, and make an impact on these people's lives."
5027,5ff9af4bd5f7,"Her project was then completed after she spent her summer building ramps, cooking meals, and painting murals for that community."
5028,5ff9af4bd5f7,"Soon after her project was completed, she decided that she would major in Social Services, because making an impact in people's lives and helping them achieve a better life was something she would want to do as a career."
5029,5ff9af4bd5f7,"By being able to choose her project, she was able to broaden all of her horizons and grow as a person as well as mentally mature through her experiences."
5030,5ff9af4bd5f7,"Once again, if there had been restrictions on that project and it was no longer on a topic of her choosing, but instead she had to complete a paper on politics, she could've spent a couple more years undecided, or she could've dropped out of college."
5031,453968cbec5f,"when students are allowed to design their own projects, they not only take their time to complete their project, but they pay attention to every last detail, and make sure that everything is done to their liking"
5032,c51e289440f1,It can be said that some of these projects are the result of passion.
5033,c51e289440f1,"For example, during my Sophomore year in high school, I was assigned a project based off a genocide of my choosing."
5034,c51e289440f1,"Originally I thought I would do this project on the Rwandan genocide, but thought better of it since I was already familiar with it."
5035,c51e289440f1,"In the end, I decided on the Cambodian Genocide and decided I would be doing a scrapbook for the execution of the project."
5036,c51e289440f1,"At first the research was a bit slow since I was unfamiliar with the topic, but as I learned more about the subject, I found a passion for the project I didn't know I had."
5037,c51e289440f1,I began working on the scrapbook everyday after school over the course of a month.
5038,c51e289440f1,"By the time the deadline had come, the project had been completed and was ready to be displayed on Genocide Night."
5039,c51e289440f1,"In the end, I was able to score a high grade, and even used my research for a project assigned for my art class a year later."
5040,6853a39f7fbe,student designed projects are beneficial for the student as it gives them the opportunity to increase their knowledge in a variety of topics as well as help them mentally mature.
5041,6853a39f7fbe,"When given the choice to infinite possibilities, there is plenty of space for infinite success."
5042,6853a39f7fbe,"Teacher designed projects, more often than not, are usually seen as boring, time consuming tasks, because they are created by someone that doesn't have a students interests in mind."
5043,6853a39f7fbe,"Projects assigned during the school year are solely based on the topic they are learning, or book they are reading in class."
5044,6853a39f7fbe,"However, summer projects should not have that restriction despite the project's purpose of making sure that students are learning."
5045,6853a39f7fbe,"Students should be allowed to take the reigns on their projects, and lead them in the direction that they want to go in."
5046,6853a39f7fbe,"When students are given the freedom of choosing, they are more inclined to learn and retain that information, then when they are forced to learn about things they could care less about."
5047,6e40d1668505,The current legal consequences of using your cell phone while driving is not that harsh compared to other states
5048,fe64fc3ccb82,"but in florida they are not that hard on them but in other states in like Georgia Colorado

Washington dc etc., but in florida it's only seen as offensive but all that changed in effect in july 2019."
5049,fe64fc3ccb82,Causing accidents on the phone and ( texting) use while driving is 15% are distracted and 20 thru 29 across the nation are the biggest culprits amongst those who use cell phones while driving 35% of them are phone fatal crashes including the 234 fatal crashes.
5050,fe64fc3ccb82,"the restriction from usage while driving I know a few states that issued the law against texting, if precautions and specially enter the car then maybe this epidemic the type of things that is not issued the most in some states that need to be in forced but aren't is the reason why that is"
5051,0881504ecf39,is because they don't see them as life threatening and that why some states still have fatal car accidents such as Georgia they still have fatal accidents because a lot of people have their phones in hand which causes them to swerve in the roads
5052,fe90647f00c0,and also they cause more trouble for emergency drivers to get by to save someone else life about 23 percent of people are more likely are to be caught up in car crashes than other driver for example just a simple decision of just replying back to a messages.
5053,fe90647f00c0,"On average three seconds after a driver is distracted overall, all these statistics are saying the same thing is that one text cam wreck all and truth be told a lot of young people has said that they sent a text while driving as an result if people being in a car accident."
5054,b007a911d1d8,People with inexperience and lacking driving skills
5055,67278114014e,cell phone use can very deadly for teen drivers
5056,85c3c5a82381,"because technology has different ways of distracting drives now and days some researchers from

Philadelphia children's hospital teens who do not frequently drive use a phone while driving believes the benefits of putting away their phone away while driving outweighs any drawbacks."
5057,202d58dc20aa,"for these teens, the benefits associate with not using a cell phone while driving include being able to pay better attention, being less likely to have a crash, and following the laws also parent have to realize that the their teens are driving and cannot call or text them they can only do so after their teen is at their destination or call them before they go on the road."
5058,cb8967532b98,"When the school year ends most students are just exited to know that they don't have to learn, knowing they can just relax, hang out with friends, or party."
5059,cb8967532b98,"On the other hand, isn't this just holding them back in their learning process?"
5060,cb8967532b98,Shouldn't they do some type of project that will allow them to exercise the mind and keep them learning?
5061,cb8967532b98,"Well it is easier for the students and for the teachers when they come back from break and the students haven't completely forgotten everything that was taught to them the previous year, so some schools decided to have students do a project over the summer break that can help these students grow as intellectuals ."
5062,cb8967532b98,"Having said that, who should decide what project to do during the break, the teacher or the student?"
5063,880b08b16f61,"Students are very lazy when they start to get closer to summer and to the break, they don't want to deal with the stress of the school."
5064,880b08b16f61,Having a project over the summer is the last thing that a student wants to do
5065,377b199274fa,"if they have the option of choosing what to do they will always chose something that isn't going to challenge them in anyway and will chose to do a easy topic that they can get done fast, that they already know, or that they have done before"
5066,4f134df65c30,"Even though students are the ones doing the project, teachers are the ones who understand the subjects that student should be learning."
5067,4f134df65c30,"If you let a student pick a subject to work on over the summer, he could chose something very unnecessary that would have no impact in the students growth as an intellectual, he could say he is doing a science project that would ask how many hours he can play a video game before he gets hungry and eats food, or before he has to go to the bathroom."
5068,4f134df65c30,Teachers who got to know and understand their students throughout the year would know what they could be interested in and would work on during the summer.
5069,4f134df65c30,For students to be interested in something they want to understand how it works and find it fun to do.
5070,4f134df65c30,In order for students to not slack off and procrastinate they must find it interesting to them or they wont work on it.
5071,4f134df65c30,"That is another thing that teachers must considered when giving out the projects that their students must do over the summer, if teachers assign the same project to everyone, many of them can get such projects done fairly quickly and not challenge them at all, having it done so soon they didn't learn anything for the project, or having all of them do the same project would just have them copy each other."
5072,eeb4c12c5232,"Having teachers know their students strengths and their weaknesses, can help the teacher determine what project the student can work on that they will enjoy doing and will challenge them, helping them learn all at the same time."
5073,ddbf1780dcbe,"All teachers want for their students is for them to be successful, in order for them to achieve such success they need to understand and go though the challenges that they have to face and the failures they must grow from in order for them to grow their knowledge as an individual."
5074,ddbf1780dcbe,"During the summer break, students benefit from having a project that can help them keep the knowledge they gained though out the school year, and not having to be shocked back into the next school year when they come back and have to re-learn stuff from the previous year that they may have forgotten, after that they can finally move forward and learn new things"
5075,65d257dd2f04,"The teachers give out this project for the whole purpose that given project helps students move forward, they assigned the project to the individual students knowing what would help them grow without having the summer break erasing everything they learned the previous year."
5076,ae49812ac9ed,"The Challenge of Exploring Venus, Venus is called the ""Evening Star"" it's one of the brightest stars in the nigh sky."
5077,ae49812ac9ed,Venus is a planet its the second planet from the sun.
5078,ae49812ac9ed,The atmopshere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus.
5079,ae49812ac9ed,NASA is tring other approaches to study Venus.
5080,ae49812ac9ed,Venus is a planet trying to be explored and studied.
5081,6c1008a1349d,Venus is the second planet in line to the sun.
5082,6c1008a1349d,"Earth's twin is Venus, Venus is the closest planet to Earth in density and the size."
5083,6c1008a1349d,"Earth, Venus and Mars are neighboring planets they all orbit the sun at different speeds."
5084,6c1008a1349d,No man has been on Venus NASA has tried to send spaceships up to Venus but the ships never survived the landing some did but they didn't make it past a few hours.
5085,6c1008a1349d,Venus has never been touched by man.
5086,a486e600e07c,The auther has good pionts he claims the average temperature on Venus is over 800 degrees and that the atmosheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on Earth.
5087,6a0b22e52036,"The auther makes good pionts of why we should study this planet, to learn to expand our minds into space."
5088,e4e6f25cafc1,Spending resources on studying planets is a good and a bad.
5089,b17c7b102302,"Studying planet that can't help us is a wate of time, finding a planet out there that have air and can grow plants is a big find and we should study those planets."
5090,b17c7b102302,"The auther has claimed that Venus has a temputer of 800 degrees no person a live can live through that so that planet is the worth taking time, resources and money to go out and study."
5091,9a829caaa1c5,Planets like ours and Mars.
5092,9a829caaa1c5,"Mars is worth all the time, resorces and money to gonout and find more about because later in our life or in the furture Mars could be the next Earth."
5093,9a829caaa1c5,NASA has aldready claimed before they have found water and grass.
5094,9a829caaa1c5,Venus has nothing close due to its 800 degrees and the atomspheric is 90 times greater than ours so you can't breathe on Venus
5095,3e320f1058b9,The auther made great claims but I feel we could foucs more on Mars and other planets like ours.
5096,d593e1555a53,"The Challenge of Exploring Venus, is not woth the study."
5097,d593e1555a53,Venus is one of the highly dangers planets our there in space.
5098,d593e1555a53,Better fouces on Mars than Venus.
5099,b7390d2e4490,The auther had great claims but the enough to sell me into the studying of Venus
5100,3bcfd23f39e7,The author wants us to learn about Venus because NASA wants us to know stuff about our other planets.
5101,f0f8b7b9a6b6,NASA wants us to learn about Venus to hopefully tell others about what we learned and maybe they will want to learn about Venus too.
5102,f0f8b7b9a6b6,"They can learn that Venus is likes Earth's ""twin"", its the closesest planet to Earth in terms of density and size and occasionally the closest distance too."
5103,587784ebe98c,You can learn who was the first to land on Venus and who was the last and how long you can stay on Venus until you have to come back down to Earth for more food and supples
5104,c212d7265fa2,"Only one spaceship can go up there because they can't have more than 3 to 4 people on Venus doing the same thing, they don't have that much room on the spaceship for everyone that wants to go on Vensu anyways."
5105,c212d7265fa2,Not everyone knows about Venus but if you go to NASA websit and look up information about it you can learn more about the planets around us and see how you can become one of the people to go on the other planets that are around us or just become one of the members on the station.
5106,21cc1e0225d7,The average temperature is 800 degrees fahrenheit there so you would need a very high powered suit to keep that from killing you if you go to Venus.
5107,5499a315fa1a,800 degrees is WAY to hot for anyone to go up there and take a look.
5108,5499a315fa1a,The ship would need to be checked out to make sure that the teperatures didn't cook the spaceship.
5109,5499a315fa1a,The air level would close to the sea level on earth so we would have to be super carefull when we get off the spaceship to get information about the planet.
5110,e92fa82c921e,You can hover over Venus and look out the windows on the spacehip to look at Venus and youc can to try get information on it from there.
5111,e92fa82c921e,"NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus, soon we will know what they are talking about."
5112,e92fa82c921e,Soon NASA will be able to get more information on Venus and if it is ready for living objects to come and live on it and if not then NASA can find another planet and study that one for a couple of years and see if that one is live able.
5113,cd6c4c3504cd,Extracurricular activities are good for everyone.
5114,cd6c4c3504cd,For example you might want to go into acting or sports.
5115,c37797c13db5,You might just want to try something new.
5116,c37797c13db5,You might think that something is boring but then you end up liking it.
5117,0eca03c40238,Just like how I never thought I would like basketball but I tried out for the team.
5118,0eca03c40238,Turns out I do like basketball and I think I'm pretty good at it.
5119,8c99599ee454,You get to meet new people and you get to try something new.
5120,8c99599ee454,If you think you like something else better you can always join that club.
5121,8c99599ee454,You might even be surprised by how much you like it.
5122,b2a537accc26,"Now, say you a new student at a new school."
5123,b2a537accc26,Like anyone else you would like to make new friends.
5124,36ddbde15ba7,"So, why don't you join a club?"
5125,36ddbde15ba7,Everyone in that club likes the same interests as you.
5126,36ddbde15ba7,You would make friends right away.
5127,36ddbde15ba7,Even if you quit everyone in that club will still be your friend.
5128,36ddbde15ba7,You can move to a different club and make friends there.
5129,29e3ccc9e009,yes I do agree that students must participate in an extracurricular activity.
5130,7b04d0c55f5d,They get to try something new.
5131,7b04d0c55f5d,They could try something that they think the don't like but then actually do.
5132,7b04d0c55f5d,They can make new friends.
5133,7b04d0c55f5d,So I think it is a good choice for students to take extracurricular activities.
5134,4e3ca3aa6e50,Leonardo Da Vinci was one of the greatest reniassance painters of the time.
5135,4e3ca3aa6e50,His study of the human anatomy allowed him to create pictures that captured the humna state.
5136,4e3ca3aa6e50,"On of his most well known paintings is the ""Mona Lisa""."
5137,4e3ca3aa6e50,The Mona Lisa is a women that has sort of complacent facial features.
5138,4e3ca3aa6e50,She doesn't really look happy or sad.
5139,4e3ca3aa6e50,This was the popular thought up until a new technology was created.
5140,4e3ca3aa6e50,This technology is called the Facial Action Coding System.
5141,4e3ca3aa6e50,This technology is able to deduce what emotion a person is feeling.
5142,4e3ca3aa6e50,It is able to do this whothout the person even showing an obvious emotion.
5143,4e3ca3aa6e50,"This technology can also be implenmented in many spheres of life, including in the classroom."
5144,34f5b595b2ee,The use of this technology to read the expressions of students in a learning envionement can help students learn more efffectivly
5145,4c72e785d245,"allowing for immediate feedback from a student allowing for the quick shift of a lesson plan,"
5146,7f619ac4aabe,being able to help and support students emotionally.
5147,de97dcad4e8a,This technology can help get immediate feedback from students.
5148,cbab2d131d66,In almost all class rooms nation wide there is a similar routine.
5149,cbab2d131d66,"Learn something, practice it for homework and then see if a student is understanding it by taking a quiz over it."
5150,cbab2d131d66,"While this may be effective, it can be imporved ten fold with the Facial Action Coding System."
5151,cbab2d131d66,The technology could understand emotion of students in present time.
5152,cbab2d131d66,A teacher wouldn't have to wait to give out a quiz to see if students were having issues.
5153,cbab2d131d66,They could teach the subject and then immediatly know if students are having difficulty unerstanding it.
5154,cbab2d131d66,"Dr. Huang, the creator of FACS, states that ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored""."
5155,cbab2d131d66,"If teachers are able to recieve this information, their teaching would become more effective."
5156,cbab2d131d66,"Teachers could change lesson plans in order to fit the needs of the students, and give extra support and help to those children that are still struggling."
5157,cbab2d131d66,FACS can also help excite studnets about learning.
5158,cbab2d131d66,"This is important because no matter how much a teacher trys to help a student, the studnet will not imporve in anything if thet do not want to learn."
5159,cbab2d131d66,"If computers are able to read if studnets are excited or bored by a lesson, teachers would add visuals and what not to make it more intersesting to a student."
5160,cbab2d131d66,"This would make them want to learn, not them being required to learn."
5161,cbab2d131d66,"totality, the ability to be able to percieve students emotions would help students academically by allowing teachers to change lesson plans that allow for more excitment and understand in classrooms."
5162,8c800545630a,"To continue, the FACS technology would help students be more emotionally stable."
5163,a12580fb0628,"While school is a vaulable place to learn new information and facts, it is really a place for children to grow and become more independent and better human beings."
5164,a12580fb0628,"While grades matter, the emotional and pyschological health of a student is far more valuable."
5165,a12580fb0628,The FACS technology could act as an army of school counselers.
5166,a12580fb0628,"High School and Middle School students tend not to share their emotions, even with their parents."
5167,a12580fb0628,"FACS could idntify students that are emotionally troubled, have depression, contemplate self harm or even have mental illness."
5168,a12580fb0628,"Once students like these are identified then counselers and social workers could step in, allowing for students to be helped."
5169,a12580fb0628,Right now students that struggle with these issues do not share their feelings.
5170,a12580fb0628,They do not get help and carry on like they are fine.
5171,a12580fb0628,"While many may turn out to be okay, even one taking their own life or somebody's else, is too much."
5172,a12580fb0628,"While FACS may not be able to help or eliminate all signs of emotional distress, it can surely make a difference."
5173,a12580fb0628,Another benfit of using FACS is that it reads emotoins silently.
5174,a12580fb0628,Students don't have to potray a certain emotion for the technology to understand what they are really feeling.
5175,a12580fb0628,"If a studnet is asked how they are, they probably give a surface level, I am fine, answer."
5176,a12580fb0628,"The technology reads through that completely, eliminating awkard one on one conversatoins with conselers, and allowing for all students to be reached."
5177,c77af8107739,While there are many positives to this technology some might argue that computers cannot actually calculate human emotion.
5178,c77af8107739,They argue that human emotion is not somehting that can or should be understood because it would ruin the entirety of feeling certain ways.
5179,15d9a651ab52,"However, while some arguements may be warranted, many are based off of falsehoods."
5180,15d9a651ab52,"To begin, emotion can be understood on a scientific level."
5181,5c651e93971d,"Emotion is in the brain, not the heart."
5182,5c651e93971d,The way the FACS understands emoion is simple.
5183,5c651e93971d,"It maps out a 3-D model of the face, looks at the shape and positoin of all the muscles, then it associates the different facial movements with differet emotion."
5184,5c651e93971d,"For example, your orbicularis oris (muscles around your mouth) tighten your lips to show when you are angry."
5185,5c651e93971d,It even works when a person it trying to mask emotions.
5186,5c651e93971d,"During a fake smile, the zygomatic major stretches the mouth sidways, while in a real smile the zygomatic major lifts the corners of the mouth."
5187,5c651e93971d,"These examples can show how science IS able to understand emotoin, probaly better than most humans."
5188,5c651e93971d,"Arguments that use that falshood, that science is unable to understand emotion, is completly false."
5189,d1cee022a827,"In conclusion, the ability to read the actual emotion and reactions of students in class rooms is extremely valuable because it allows for greater understanding and excitment of a subject, along with the ability to help students be emotionally stable."
5190,d1cee022a827,"If this technology is implemented into schools, studnets will overall do better, feel better and make a brighter world for tomorrow."
5191,d1cee022a827,FACS is something revolutionary that hopefully all of us can learn somthing from.
5192,9fbe169a9cbd,Why you should not need to take one extracurricular activity to pass the school year.
5193,9fbe169a9cbd,The principle has decided that you need to take at lest one extracurricular activity to pass each school year.
5194,9fbe169a9cbd,Here are some reasons
5195,370d869add8e,.
5196,370d869add8e,"One it can give the student stress, by making them worried about if he or she will pass."
5197,c1ed88d64ab5,"Two it can start a loss in productivity, by making the students' work rate slow down and make them struggle more"
5198,0005969dea79,"Three it will overload the student, because they might be going for a advanced diploma and that would pile on top of the student making it hard for the student to do his or her work."
5199,922f992c31cc,Those were a few reasons why you should not need to take a extracurricular activity to pass the school year.
5200,3a28c9cca56e,Taking a extracurricular activity can cause lots of stress to a student
5201,c8e0858b3b61,"by, first making the student get lower grades, because they have to split their focus to two things at once therefore making the student worried about if he or she will pass the year."
5202,c8e0858b3b61,"Second can make the students upset, by making the student do more work then they need."
5203,c8e0858b3b61,"Third it can drive the students insane, by making the students do way too much school work."
5204,c8e0858b3b61,"Those were some reasons why, you should not need to take a extracurricular activity to pass the school year."
5205,fe7bed3e4eec,Taking a extracurricular activity can create a loss in productivity.
5206,2fac9e2d8c09,"First it can make them want to stop trying to get good grades, simply by giving the student a lot of work and barely any time to relax."
5207,2fac9e2d8c09,"Second it can stop the student focus dead in it's tracks, just because there is a little too much work for the student to keep going and work."
5208,2fac9e2d8c09,"Third

It will also slow down the student work rate and make them feel like they need to study more which then will put the student in a very bad mental place."
5209,2fac9e2d8c09,"Those were also some reasons why, you should not need to take a extracurricular activity to pass the school year."
5210,74106a2e8931,Taking a extracurricular activity can overload some students.
5211,ce185d3d5ad4,"First it can make the student do too much work, because some students are going for a advanced diploma and if they had to do a extracurricular activity that would pile on top of the student making him or her do too much work."
5212,ce185d3d5ad4,Second some student might have other activities to do out side of school so that would just stop them from doing what they enjoy after school.
5213,ce185d3d5ad4,"Third it may also make students miss out on certain events that happen every couple of years, like for say you wanted to go to a concert that a band was doing and that was there last concert that they will ever do, you would really want to go, but as long as you have a extracurricular activity you might not be able to go and watch the performance in person."
5214,ce185d3d5ad4,Those were the final reasons why should not need to take a extracurricular activity to pass the school year.
5215,3ac1b946df9f,"Those are a few reason why, you should not need to take a extracurricular activity to pass the school year."
5216,3ac1b946df9f,Another reason is because it can cause stress by making the student focus on two things at once therefore bring the students grades down and make the student worried about if he or she will pass the year.
5217,3ac1b946df9f,Another reason is it can create a loss in productivity by slowing down the work rate of the student making them feel dumb or behind in class.
5218,3ac1b946df9f,The final reason to wrap it up is that it can overload a student by giving them too much work permanently putting themselves in a bad mental state at school just because of a little too much work.
5219,3ac1b946df9f,Those were all the reasons why you should not need a extracurricular activity to pass the school year.
5220,00264751395f,Many poeple are saying it looks as if it's a face or some sort.
5221,00264751395f,"Some peopel are even saying aliens have put it on Mars to tell us soemthing, but I hilly dout that."
5222,a1a1371647f4,He began to say that ailens put it there!
5223,75a03f7d5191,All I could think of is why and how would they do it.
5224,1a66a497a489,"They may not even be real, we have no evidence to show that soemthing living lives up on Mars."
5225,1a66a497a489,I had began to tell him that's it's not possiable!
5226,1a66a497a489,I even gave facts about how anything livinh like humans or animals couldn't live up there.
5227,1a66a497a489,But he still thought it was true.
5228,adf2cfa3c9d1,The face on Mars had been getting bigger and many poeple hadn't though aliens did it after reading my page.
5229,adf2cfa3c9d1,By doing so much research I sort of made a differnce about it and Im proud to say all the hard work turned out to be a amazing thing to do.
5230,0594c0569407,"In the article ""Making Mons Lisa Smile,"" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enable computers to identify human emotions"
5231,a61bcc6f44dd,I disagee about using of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.
5232,ae23c115d9c0,"Technology, such as phones, laptops, or any devices, is not always true."
5233,ae23c115d9c0,They can predict about how people feel or their emtions.
5234,ae23c115d9c0,"For example, in the second paragraph in the first sentence, it says, ""The process begins when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face""."
5235,90dc20873391,Every people have different types of emotions.
5236,90dc20873391,It's true that they have different kinds of emotions but what if it is fake?
5237,76d89c428137,Computers are like robots.
5238,76d89c428137,Computers can't prefer if someone is smiling or upset.
5239,76d89c428137,Computers don't understand if someone is really smiling for real or faking smiling.
5240,76d89c428137,It depends on someone's face.
5241,76d89c428137,"For instance, when a friend talk something fun, I smile but when a friend talk something boring, I smile too so they can be happy."
5242,a6ddd33c13b4,Is putting on a happy face actually work?
5243,a6ddd33c13b4,I prefer not because it depends on someone's emotions inside instead of the outside.
5244,1bed6f33b600,Not everybody can read someone's mind.
5245,1bed6f33b600,"In the last paragraph in the second sentence, it says, ""According to the Facial Feedback Theory of Emotions, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them""."
5246,c9a494a2666a,"It can be true, but it can be false."
5247,c9a494a2666a,People don't know what is going to happen next.
5248,c9a494a2666a,So people have to figure out on their own.
5249,c9a494a2666a,So I disagree that about using of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable.
5250,b07a953a9d54,Have you ever wanted to participate in a extracurricular program?
5251,b07a953a9d54,"Students must participate in at least one sport, work on the year books,or serve on the student council."
5252,b07a953a9d54,"This will help the students stay healthy,caleberate with others,or educate the students in different understandings."
5253,b07a953a9d54,This way the students can be perductive in their time.

5260,fc4f42b6dc2f,"The yearbooks price will be 15$.You can capture the excitment,the memories, and the price of 15$."
5261,c5124a298a82,Have you ever wanted to play a sport?
5262,1f0e93afd91b,Sports have been on this planet for many years.

5264,1f0e93afd91b,These are all good ways of staying active.
5265,1f0e93afd91b,"Sports have been alive for many years , they also keep you healthy so you can live an easy life."
5266,4d9d420ff96f,Have you ever wanted to be apart of the school council?
5267,fa7935b347ea,The school council is a great program.
5268,fa7935b347ea,They all you the make statments for the schools.
5269,fa7935b347ea,This is one of many choices to be a leader.
5270,fa7935b347ea,"School council is a great extracurricluar program for students it makes staments,and is a good choice to be a leader."
5271,8b946ecd2d58,I agree with the princapal to make students be involved with extracurricluar prgrams.
5272,c47d2eda33dd,Sports is an easy way to be involved by saying healthy and being perductive.
5273,c47d2eda33dd,Yearbooks is a great ways be involed and to make a memorial of the schools years.
5274,c47d2eda33dd,Student council is a great way to help when needed and to make the school a better place.
5275,6d38640375ef,I think it should be student designed
5276,f2993d79e080,some students take the summer to travel to family members houses and stuff like that.
5277,aeb127c18a2c,"So i think if the mom thinks the student needs to go to summer school that's her decion, students stay in school for 9 months a year so that's plenty of time to get everything they need done by summer."
5278,aeb127c18a2c,that can cause alot of disagreements with the family.
5279,aeb127c18a2c,"Let's say the mom wants you to go to summer school but the dad thinks otherwise because yall already have plans to do somthing different, summer school can cause an arguement."
5280,9bca6be34c58,"I think if it was a teacher-designed, some teachers would only pick certian kids that they didn't like or somthing maybe and that wouldn't be far, also the teachers wouldn't know if they already have plans for somthing different or not"
5281,e061634fc7d1,It should be the parents decions why or why not.
5282,e061634fc7d1,"But if it was a teacher-designed more students would come and catch up on more work or somthing like that so it could also be good at the same point, for instence let's say your behide on a sol and have to gradute in the summer if you would of just went to summer school in ur highschool days maybe you wouldn't have to gradute in the summer."
5283,e061634fc7d1,"So it could go both ways i think but if your a student then you should know if you need to go to summer school or not because it won't be fair for your parents to know everything, you got a part in it to."
5284,34b6269f7c4b,"therefor, i think it should be students-designed because they might have plans for the summer or might not need summer school."
5285,34b6269f7c4b,But if they need it and don't go then it's there fault not the teachers because atleast they provide summer school to students that need it.
5286,eedc33220546,Texting and driving is not what we need and American.
5287,7abc4cf4607a,"We as teens think it's cool to drive fast

Respect."
5301,09b6182569a2,"Using this type of technology can be somewhat unsafe to students in classrooms, beacsue what if they aren't happy and someone uses the Facial Action Coding System, but then reveals how the person really feels."
5302,a6aa122b3cd2,More into the future it has gotten to a point that companies will stop at nothing for growth and development.
5303,a6aa122b3cd2,But these things can cause a major unbalnce to everyone.
5304,a6aa122b3cd2,"Just like the Facial Action Coding System, this thing can be someones enemy, becasue maybe this person can be against the whole thing."
5305,a6aa122b3cd2,And using it on some one that didn't want to be used could lead the person to do bad things.
5306,d2f15ae71d2f,"On the other hand, other people can come foward and say ""it is time for change"" and be all happy, and the next thing you know is that the world is run be robots."

5311,28acc9ef0348,But then he just let is go and began to draw.
5312,28acc9ef0348,"And now we are here, to the future and people wanting to knoww how another perosn feels by using a computer."
5313,e7f32bf73888,"Like i've stated before, change can go in a good or bad way."
5314,e7f32bf73888,There is no way saying it could be both or could be something completly different.
5315,e7f32bf73888,We just got to be careful with what we have now or they may be no future.
5316,64c54fc452a9,Summer break provides students with a time to relax and refresh in preparation for the following year.
5317,64c54fc452a9,The break is a necessity in the school systems as it offers students the opportunity to experience different aspects of life outside of the classroom.
5318,64c54fc452a9,"Additionally, this period to refresh assists students in their learning career as it prevents academic burnout."
5319,64c54fc452a9,"However, some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break"
5320,4fa6c4c2806c,"In situations where summer projects are assigned, projects should be student-designed"
5321,a8e0f31ed98d,"for they allow students to take initiative in their learning,"
5322,65006446836f,gain a deeper understanding of the chosen topic
5323,0681bf448cf3,minimize the chance that students feel they are not being given a break.
5324,e4bf1ed0f224,"In allowing students to design their own project, the student is given the opportunity to take charge of their learning."
5325,4d8b21bf93ec,The initiative a student-designed project offers allows students to choose a topic they are interested in and later hope to pursue.
5326,4d8b21bf93ec,"For example, a young student with little interest in art and literature would not benefit from being forced to read certain novels throughout the summer."
5327,4d8b21bf93ec,Exposure to the essential texts needed to further their language abilities will be gained throughout the school year.
5328,4d8b21bf93ec,"Therefore, as the school year already provides students with the basic skills to advance their academic career, summer should be a time students have the opportunity to pursue their own interests, best achieved through the completion of student-designed projects."
5329,110cbcd5cf1e,"Likewise, with the idea that a student designs a project on a topic they are interested in, the project will be done more thoroughly, allowing students to gain a deeper understanding."
5330,0fe1e68cfc95,"As a human tendency, people are more likely to work on something they are interested and excited about."
5331,0fe1e68cfc95,"The more the project is worked on, the more complex and thorough it will be."
5332,0fe1e68cfc95,Interest and excitement in a topic positively affect the extent to which the project will be worked on.
5333,0fe1e68cfc95,"Typically, the time spent on the project is directly related to the overall understanding of the concept."
5334,0fe1e68cfc95,"Considering teachers assign summer work to assure students continue learning during their break, projects should be student-designed as they promote a deeper understanding of the given topic."
5335,cdb4d1f14309,having students complete a project they have designed themselves minimizes the feeling of the traditional school dynamic
5336,de84d0ffd0c8,"Throughout the school year, students are assigned the work they need to complete in order to receive an ""A."""
5337,de84d0ffd0c8,Completing work is often done out of requirement rather than personal interest.
5338,de84d0ffd0c8,Summer is used as a break from the many requirements of school.
5339,de84d0ffd0c8,A student-designed project will seem like less of a requirement as it is based upon self-interest.
5340,de84d0ffd0c8,Minimizing the feeling that the work must be done out of requirement ensures students have the time to refresh while continuing their academics.
5341,638cbf528fd6,summer is a vital time for students to take a break from the hardships of the previous school year.
5342,638cbf528fd6,"Yet, some teachers want to assure students continue their learning over the break."
5343,638cbf528fd6,"If a school believes summer work should be assigned, projects should be student-designed."
5344,638cbf528fd6,"A project designed by a student encourages them to take initiative in their learning, gain a deeper understanding of the chosen topic, and still feel as if they had a break from school and its traditional dynamic."
5345,e89f87919604,This story is really about how many people studying about Mona Lisa and how the way her mood is.
5346,403a3a7941b7,Lots of people try to figure out her history on her emotions.
5347,403a3a7941b7,Someone uses a 3d computer and he figures out that she has 6 other emotions of herself.
5348,369a0a31c0b1,Some people try to study her history from back in the day because of why she dosent smile that often and why is she always angry.
5349,b1932205e118,Some people perform an impressive calculation on her feelings by the look of her face.
5350,b99e4cbe33db,Conclusion: The whole story is about why people wonder why Mona Lisa never smiles that often.
5351,b99e4cbe33db,People uses lots of technology to try to figure out the way her mood was before she had 6 different emotions someone calls the person who knows lots of history about the story.
5352,b99e4cbe33db,Then they figure out that she did finaly smile during a painting class.
5353,b99e4cbe33db,By the look of her face the first time that someone notist lots of people were impressed it raised your eyebrows when you where surprised.
5354,b99e4cbe33db,Her smile really did change some back story about her first mood.
5355,1628c24984cf,I was a Seagoing Cowboy.
5356,1628c24984cf,I help feed the horses that are getting tranported to Europe.
5357,44b981e8fa68,I remember that one time I tried to convince some other people to join the program.
5358,44b981e8fa68,It didn't go so well.
5359,a4a7e18f176d,"
""I don't like the sea air"", ""I hate the ocean"", "" I can't swim"", ""What we get tropedoed?"
5360,a4a7e18f176d,"I can't swim"", I have allergies to horses""."
5361,a4a7e18f176d,These are exuses I get when I try to convince other people to join the progam I am in.
5362,a4a7e18f176d,"I did convince some, but not a lot."
5363,a4a7e18f176d,Most think that I am a creep.
5364,a4a7e18f176d,They try to get away from me.
5365,a4a7e18f176d,"I am always sad when I see them walk away, but at least I tried."
5366,a4a7e18f176d,Eventuly I gave up trying to convince them.
5367,a4a7e18f176d,"So here I am, on the sea, thinking about the people that I tried to get them to join."
5368,a4a7e18f176d,"Every time that I thought about them, I think about what they are doing right now."
5369,a4a7e18f176d,"When I was discharged, I went off to find every single one of the people and tell about my journys."
5370,a4a7e18f176d,They always say the same thing.
5371,a4a7e18f176d,"""I wish I joined the program."""
5372,a4a7e18f176d,Then we have a good talk about what they did while I was overseas.
5373,a4a7e18f176d,I feel like that I have more friends than I used to before.
5374,20a8505f0ee6,In today's world texting and driving is a normal thing.
5375,20a8505f0ee6,"Over 660,000 deaths and 1.6 million crashes a year, people do it on a regular bases without thinking about it."
5376,876471bac7f7,Texting and driving needs to stop now before more people get hurt.
5377,3267475f58bb,ADD is a big reason too for people have no choice but to get distracted on things which cause crashes.
5378,f1fb16caebbd,"Distraction is the main reason crashes happen, people get distracted on anything and everything and don't know what to do when they're about to crash"
5379,47479a71d1bf,"Phones are big distractions in the world today, especially in teens who just start driving, when they get a message the first thing they know to do is check it no matter what."
5380,47479a71d1bf,"To fix this problem states have inflicted heavier laws, for example Georgia has the no hands law and that means you can't have any hands on your phone at all, not even calls can be answered."
5381,47479a71d1bf,Texting while driving is such a bad choice because it can cause you to swerve off road or swerve into someone's car.
5382,47479a71d1bf,It's a bad habit in today's society and it needs to be stopped.
5383,9c3ca0565487,"In conclusion texting and driving is all out bad, and needs to be stopped, there needs to be classes and more lessons taught on the effects of texting and driving."
5384,9c3ca0565487,People need to also set an example for the new future because if it's not in forced more teens are liable to do it.
5385,5e96c82986a0,"Everyday you see kids participating in football, baseball, basketball, and other extracurricular activities, it is part of the balanced day for most kids."
5386,e40e524517cc,"Extracurricular activities are important and enjoyed by most, but I believe children should not be forced to do activities like sports or clubs."
5387,18d4de5e85a1,Even though extracurricular activities are important they are hard for some to do.
5388,18d4de5e85a1,Many parents and kids nowadays don't have time for these activities with all the work and homework they have to do.
5389,6290d6a8fefe,Also some kids have disabilities or mental disabilities that cause problems when they are trying to do activities like football or yearbook club.
5390,b001e590c120,Homework is a required part of school and some schools give more homework than others.
5391,b001e590c120,"In schools that offer AP level classes students have about 4-5 hours of homework each day, giving them no time to do extracurricular activities."
5392,b001e590c120,"Kids are stressed with this work, and putting other activities on top of it is just creating more stress."
5393,b001e590c120,"Parents don't have time too because the average workday takes up most of their time, and driving kids back and forth from each activity can really mess up a parent's schedule."
5394,b001e590c120,An average workday for parents is about 8 or 9 hours and work is hard and demanding for most parents.
5395,b001e590c120,This is why the principal should not force kids to do extracurricular activities because some just simply don't have the time.
5396,4b6d50179229,"These disabilities cause some kids to have trouble with school work, focusing, and completing simple tasks such as writing with a pencil."
5397,4b6d50179229,This is why it would not be beneficial to force these kids to do extracurricular activities.
5398,4b6d50179229,"The rigorous work of clubs like a math club, a yearbook club, or a reading club would overstimulate some of these kids."
5399,4b6d50179229,"It would lead to tantrums, fits, and bad behavior from some of these kids, and it would distract the other club members from their work."
5400,4b6d50179229,"Extracurricular activities like baseball or football would not be beneficial for them either because some of these kids with disabilities have trouble throwing a ball, standing up straight, and walking if it is a serious case."
5401,4b6d50179229,"While it is not a bad thing for kids with disabilities or mental disabilities to join a club or sport, it is just harder for some of them to do extracurricular activities because of their underlying issues."
5402,48be3426e901,This is why I believe kids should not be forced to participate in extracurricular activities because while they are beneficial they are hard for some.
5403,48be3426e901,"Extracurricular activities cause issues for parents and kids with no time, and in some cases they force kids with disabilities to do things they cannot do."
5404,48be3426e901,"For example, some parents have work from 8 am until 7 pm and this would not allow any time for drop off and pick up."
5405,48be3426e901,"Also kids have a lot of homework, opening up little time for kids to do extracurricular activities."
5406,48be3426e901,Lastly some kids with disabilities and mental disabilities just don't have the capacity to participate in extracurricular activities.
5407,48be3426e901,"Many say that extracurricular activities should be required, but I feel forcing all kids to do them is wrong"
5408,74b861b2b945,Throughout our school career's projects are often assigned to extend learning during the summer break.
5409,74b861b2b945,Summer projects are more often created by teachers.
5410,74b861b2b945,These projects are rather extensive due to the months that are given to complete it.
5411,74b861b2b945,Those who may oppose state that it is the teachers job to create these summer assignments and they are able to bring more structure to the project
5412,13ac395fc273,"Although some may disagree that student projects should be designed by teachers, it should be known that this is not true."
5413,6cfdb64d4599,Students creating their own summer projects can benefit them as students.
5414,c6856e50ec44,"Assignments that are completed by students are created by teachers, followed by a due date in which it is to be completed."
5415,c6856e50ec44,After the assignment is completed the moving on to the next.
5416,c6856e50ec44,Over time assignments become a chore and are less likely to be completed by students.
5417,c6856e50ec44,Allowing students the chance to create their own summer project that they would truly excited to work.
5418,c6856e50ec44,Through their own creation topics that students are interested about can be integrated into the summer project.
5419,c6856e50ec44,Even though the summer project could be less structured it would completed time and time again.
5420,c6856e50ec44,Having created their own assignments students would better understand what is to be expected in the terms of how to not only completed but also pass.
5421,c6856e50ec44,Once on summer break students are unable to contact teachers if they have any questions about the project through having created it themselves this would eliminate the unanswered questions.
5422,c6856e50ec44,If students were allowed to create their own summer projects it would give them a sense of control over their learning that is often lost throughout the school year.
5423,c6856e50ec44,Some students can become detached from their learning with endless amounts of work that is assigned to them.
5424,c6856e50ec44,Through the creation their summer projects it would also allow students to place their input and become more hands on within their learning.
5425,6cd6364a3ed5,"Through creating their own assignments, students are able to build qualities that are helpful in a work environment."
5426,603730b5b477,The process of coming up with rubrics and topics in which the assignment could be upon can be difficult.
5427,603730b5b477,Team collaboration is vital for creating an assignment along side teachers and other students.
5428,603730b5b477,Having the ability to voice an idea or criticism can be useful not only within school but also in an work environment.
5429,603730b5b477,Not only having to create but also complete their assignment helps develop a sense of work ethic that is helpful in any situation.
5430,603730b5b477,Students often rush to complete assignments very last minute and having formulated the assignment they would have a better understanding of how to space out their time to complete the summer project correctly.
5431,603730b5b477,Along with school assignments this skill can be applied to any work place.
5432,1cfb2b9bc2d2,Summer projects can help extend learning outside of school during summer break.
5433,1cfb2b9bc2d2,Through students creating their own summer project there is a better understanding of the project but also an excitement to complete it.
5434,1cfb2b9bc2d2,Having created their project a sense of control over students learning can be gained which is often lost throughout the school year.
5435,273061829880,Those who oppose may state that teachers should create summer projects because they have more experience than students and that teachers are able to introduce new topics to students.
5436,613f15506d1d,"Students are often detached from their learning; therefor, allowing them to create a project that could possibly worked on for months can help student regain their love of learning."
5437,8b59e65bf3f2,Explorering venus comes with a high pay off but high risk.
5438,ffec42953f96,The authors claim is correct becuase it has enough information ot back up the idea.
5439,71977e0405bc,Venus's geographical and atmospheric condtions would not be ideal but it would provide anthor option for colonization in the future.
5440,7da51e31113d,The exploration of Venus is worth while scientific endver.
5441,eb3a409b618c,The Authors study on Venus provides enought facts and evidnece to condiser further evaluation of the planet.
5442,05080328fdbf,"""Long ago, venus was probaly coverd in large oceans and could have supported varouis forms of life, just like earth today""."
5443,05080328fdbf,The planet has a surface temperature of 800 degrees farien height.
5444,05080328fdbf,Also the planet has a much higher atmospheric pressure at over 90 times greater than Earth.
5445,0cb258ee997a,Venus is closer to our plant than we thought.
5446,0cb258ee997a,Even thought its atmosphere contains clouds that are made out of higly corrosive acid.
5447,0cb258ee997a,"""The surface has a rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountians, and craters""."
5448,0cb258ee997a,The terrian is showen to be ruff but not unbarable for human colonization.
5449,0cb258ee997a,Also Venus is one the closest planets to own own planetthan most others.
5450,0cb258ee997a,The due to the ground condtions being hostile surveyers would need to be located 30 or more miles above the surface of the planet.
5451,89619e9bd976,Exploring Venus would a beinificail and woth while scientific endver.
5452,89619e9bd976,Over the years Venus has been a topic of study due to its earth like qualites.
5453,89619e9bd976,The temperature of Venus is not as freindly to humans as our own atmosphereVenus is one the closest planets to own planet than most others.
5454,89619e9bd976,"Lastly, the exploration of venus can be the next ground breaking scientific discovery yet."
5455,c3b9fe8dbb10,Why should you become a Seagoing Cowboy?
5456,c3b9fe8dbb10,Well first let me tell you about a boy named Luke who was a Seagoing Cowboy.
5457,c3b9fe8dbb10,A Seagoing Cowboy is on this boat with other Seagoing Cowboys.
5458,c3b9fe8dbb10,To go help Europe where World War II just ended.
5459,c224ce987211,"They were heading over to Europe because, many countries over there were ruined."
5460,c224ce987211,"So they were coming over to bring them food supplies, animals, and more"
5461,6f78070b110c,"If you love to help, this would be something for you that you would enjoy"
5462,eb35d8836a09,When Luke was on the boat he had a job to do.
5463,eb35d8836a09,He had to feed the animals and keep them healthy.
5464,eb35d8836a09,He also had to clean the animals and keep there stalls clean.
5465,00bf0f5c4ad9,When your a Seagoing Cowboy you have a big responsibility.
5466,8a0c8eac10cb,A Seagoing Cowboy wasn't always working.
5467,d1a95d6c84d9,When they unloaded the animals and were heading back there was an empty space.
5468,d1a95d6c84d9,So sometimes the cowboys played games.
5469,d1a95d6c84d9,"Like baseball, volleyball, table-tennis, fincing, boxing, and more."
5470,d1a95d6c84d9,Luke always enjoyed that part.
5471,c99cc9c0b1d7,So this is what a Seagoing Cowboy is and what he does.
5472,c99cc9c0b1d7,If your someone who's willing to be on a boat for a long time and take care of animals and if you also love to help people.
5473,c99cc9c0b1d7,This job is perfect for you.
5474,c99cc9c0b1d7,While your on the boat you get to make new friends and explore unique places.
5475,c99cc9c0b1d7,It was just a big adevnture.
5476,c99cc9c0b1d7,Also if you love dealing with animals this is another good reason to become a Seagoing Cowboy
5477,dea669f3c6c7,"Luke loved being a Seagoing Cowboy and if you have the heart like Luke, this is the job for you."
5478,ffd60b4fc097,"Well the advantages of limiting car usage is that you can walk to stores that are closer near by, without the need to turn on your car."
5479,a194a33a1769,Mostly the primary car limiting factor is for not to pay for gasoline  and gasoline  taxes.
5480,a194a33a1769,"In the United States the Eviromental Protection Agency is promoting ""car reduced"" comunnitiues to limit cars all around the world."
5481,a194a33a1769,The goverment expects buses and taxis to play a much better role on giving trasportation to citizens that cannot afford a car.
5482,a194a33a1769,The goverment says that 80% of the bills payment by them is going to fix highways and that only 20% of the other bills they use it for transport.
5483,f84b446b13b2,Paris enforces a driving ban to clear the air of the global city.

5486,f84b446b13b2,More than 20 peoplae got theit cars impounded for their reaction to the fine of paris.
5487,f84b446b13b2,Diesel fuel company was blamed since France has a tax policy that favors diesel  over gasoline.
5488,f84b446b13b2,Diesel fuel company makes up 67% of vehicles in France.
5489,f84b446b13b2,For this kind of behavior Delivery companies complained for loss of buisness.

5495,8cbc0c83e346,"Some recrent studies suggest that americans ar buyinga few more cars than usual, Driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."
5496,dfca6c1fdf7a,"In today's day and age, we are privileged to have the ability to drive vehicles anywhere that we please."
5497,dfca6c1fdf7a,The use of technology gave us the responsibility of driving.
5498,dfca6c1fdf7a,"With that being said the responsibility of driving is very important because you're not only putting your life at risk, but also other drivers on the road."
5499,dfca6c1fdf7a,There can be many distractions while you are driving which can cause you to wreck and be seriously injured from it.
5500,dfca6c1fdf7a,One of the biggest distractions in today's age is the use of cellphones.
5501,dfca6c1fdf7a,"With the improvements made to technology, you can use cellphones anywhere on the road, which causes it to be the number one distraction."
5502,01da3398695d,I personally feel that the use of technology should not be allowed while driving unless it is under an extreme circumstance.
5503,8a207493ebf9,"To begin, one of the main reasons that causes cellphones to be one of the most distracting items is due to the texting and driving"
5504,5621bf4dccad,"According to the National Safety Council they reported that ""cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes each year""."
5505,5621bf4dccad,"They also reported that ""nearly 390,000 injuries occur each year from accidents caused by texting while driving."
5506,5621bf4dccad,"With those outrageously high statistics, I strongly agree with the idea of doing away with cellphones while driving."
5507,5621bf4dccad,"Also, 94 percent of drivers support a ban on texting while driving and 74 percent support a ban on hand held cell phone use."
5508,5621bf4dccad,Having that high of a support percentage shows that are many other people who feel the same as I do.
5509,5621bf4dccad,It is a very dangerous problem that is going on in todays day.
5510,5621bf4dccad,"With myself being a high school student and driver, I can first hand tell you this is a major proem with teens."
5511,5621bf4dccad,I see many of my friends and also other students of my school using their cellphones while there driving and putting themselves in dangerous situations.
5512,fcaac5f36deb,As the majority of people know the using your phone is very dangerous and also distracting.
5513,fcaac5f36deb,"However, with the teen's situations there are 16-year old's and older who are not that experienced with driving but are also more easily distracted then adults"
5514,32b84c28a2f6,"There was a poll made by AAA saying that ""94 percent of teen drivers know the dangers of using their phone while driving and up to 34 percent admitted to doing it anyway""."
5515,32b84c28a2f6,With this kind of statistic just proves the point of not allowing any use of a phone in a motor vehicle
5516,aebd4b6390c2,"There are many other safe and focused drivers on the road, who are following all the rules of the road."
5517,aebd4b6390c2,Those careful drivers have also been the victims and ended up being seriously injured from the distracted driving with phones and also many other reasons.
5518,0807ee0ccc99,I personally have an example to give with this problem.
5519,0807ee0ccc99,"My Cousin was killed by a driver who was going down a road, speeding in the rain, and also texting while driving on top of all that."
5520,0807ee0ccc99,"Phones being used in motorized vehicles is a serious issue and luckily a law has passed in the state of Georgia, stopping the use of them in cars, but hopefully people will start to follow that law."
5521,43043a6df633,"There are plenty of other distractions that go on when driving a motorized vehicle, but the use of phones is most caused."
5522,43043a6df633,These deaths and accidents from distracted driving with your phones can be very managed.
5523,43043a6df633,If people were to follow the law of not using them in the car and to be more careful then these outrages percentages will become more and more less.
5524,43043a6df633,"Also, I would like to express the fact that there are many options in vehicles that allow you to use your devices via Bluetooth and voice control."
5525,43043a6df633,"So, if there was an emergency you can answer and talk on the phone without even having to pick up your phone and looking away."
5526,43043a6df633,This concludes my essay I strongly believe in not using your devices while driving and I hope to have expressed the effect is has.
5527,1054d44d5373,"""Venus is the closest planet to earths in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."""
5528,9985c37e3ca8,"The author is sayin sinse venus is basicly another copy of earth will extra extreme features, we should still look into it."
5529,5b1b1d785e67,"Venus are acid rain, 800 defrees fahrenheit and has only 3% of oxygen and 97% carbon dioxide."
5530,5b1b1d785e67,"""Astronomers are fasinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in out solar system."
5531,5b1b1d785e67,"Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like earth."""
5532,5dcb9a86ac29,The aurthor explains why people are so interested in venus and why they want to study and look more into the planet and its possabilities.
5533,219897bb3d97,Now people know that venus is not fit for life forms now.
5534,219897bb3d97,Even people who have gotten close anough to venus couldnt get even close to study the surface of venus.
5535,219897bb3d97,"They dont get a whole lot of time to look at venus because of its light and how bright it is, if people attempted to take a photo of venus it would not come out how they wanted."
5536,219897bb3d97,They only way we get any idea of venus and its surface is from the human eye.
5537,219897bb3d97,"We are never able to get close anough for samples because we would need to get extremely close and we cant because of its heat, gases."
5538,219897bb3d97,"Venus could easily burn through most metals from earth, but astronomers think using old technology or a mechanical computer could help figure out more on venus."
5539,219897bb3d97,The mechanical computer actually doesnt involve electronical equipment.
5540,219897bb3d97,"Thats how the parts to the mechanical computer is made, is by heat, pressure and other types of forces"
5541,1f04c9644e62,"People think just because its dangerous to go to venus, doesnt mean we cant attempt it"
5542,42c9c8f2d24c,"They also say, ""Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."""
5543,42c9c8f2d24c,"Telling us that its not possible and if you think about it, it could happen and can be possible to travel to venus."
5544,42c9c8f2d24c,"NASA has been thinking of ways to build a ship that could with stand venus and its heat an pressure, and how to make it safe anough to be able to get there and collect supplies and leave without being in any type of harm."
5545,e268745c0035,The author very well supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.
5546,e268745c0035,They are very pasionate about the idea because they provide lots of facts and reasoning to further support the claim.
5547,3206acd1e6cd,"The author uses support mainly focused on the idea in paragraphs 4, 5, and 6."
5548,3206acd1e6cd,"In paragraph 4, the author said that Venus is theorized to once be covered in water, able to provide homes for all sorts of little organisms."
5549,3206acd1e6cd,"They also say that Venus might have been the ""most Earth-like planet in our solar system."""
5550,3206acd1e6cd,"They compared it to Earth even more because of how it has a rocky surface and has similar valleys, mountains, and craters"
5551,c15ec2bf33d5,The author spent time comparing Venus to Earth's surface and features for remote resembalance.
5552,0f6608f7efa4,"Later, in paragraph 5, the author mentions how NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has ""one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus."""
5553,99de39fbd2d9,"This furthers the point more that NASA is also trying to send humans to go visit and study our planet's ""twin""."
5554,99de39fbd2d9,"The author then goes on, proceeding to help our visualization of NASA's plan, telling the reader that NASA would not directly put humans on Venus's surface, but rather have them float in a blimp-like vehicle above the startpoint of Venus's weather and ""avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up ad out of their way."""
5555,99de39fbd2d9,"The author lastly pointed out how, even with the toasty weather, Venus' surface is still survivable for humans, even though it's not full of easy conditions."
5556,fe3d44bf34d9,"Moreover, the author gives reasoning that ""peering at Venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannnot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendering standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."""
5557,fe3d44bf34d9,"Researchers could also not be able to take any samples of anything from Venus from a distance if NASA were to proceed with the blimp-like plan,"
5558,9764b3146cbb,"the researchers would have no other choice but to go down onto Venus to take samples, even though it's dangerous."
5559,d2a50afb7e59,The author demonstrates how the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents by explaining many supporting reasons.
5560,d2a50afb7e59,"They make it obvious that Venus is indeed safe to visit under the right precautions and that, with all the facts provided in paragraphs 4,5, and 6, it is a planet that us survivable for humans."
5561,d2a50afb7e59,"The author supports thier standpoint fairly well with all the information they provided, even referencing NASA."
5562,d2a50afb7e59,This author fairly supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.
5563,116f5de67a60,- The author does support the idea very well of studying Venus is worthy of pursuit despite the dangers.
5564,d89058037a84,"- Venus is a cloud draped planet, it is often referred as Earth's twin because Venus is the closest planet to Earth and sometimes Mars, humans sent spacecraft to Venus but unmanned because not one single spaceship has touched down in Venus in three decades,"
5565,e043beef219e,humans have to study everything about Venus because of Venus's reputation it is a very challenging planet.
5566,00a8fc1d7501,"Venus was used to be the most Earth-like planet in our solar system because long ago it was covered with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."
5567,a93d47e58f63,"Venus still has some features such as valleys, mountains, and craters"
5568,cd8b59fdfd51,NASA has a compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus
5569,705fbc0d4d3b,Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus.
5570,3b544f65d867,NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus.
5571,3b544f65d867,"Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiousity will likely lead us into many equally imtimidating endeavors"
5572,f59ca4df68a9,"Scientist know that the face is created by something else, but someone thinks aliens created it."
5573,eca9dc29ac87,I don't think aliens can do that.
5574,eca9dc29ac87,"Many things could be the cause of the face on Mars, but I'm sure it's not aliens"
5575,f18773ee13a2,Scientist have not proven that aliens are even real yet.
5576,f18773ee13a2,"If aliens were real scientist would know about it, and they might try to capture one"
5577,00dda6612cfb,"The face would of been causes by wind,"
5578,67eaac0b5574,"the spacecraft,"
5579,fed5f6b08ea3,or it could of been a natural landform.
5580,315289b47c81,The face on Mars could have been caused by the wind
5581,809a902c84f8,"When planets rotate it could have cause some wind, and the wind could start to form piles of dirt."
5582,809a902c84f8,The dirt could have been moved into the shape of a face.
5583,809a902c84f8,"The shadows give it an illusion of eye, nose, and mouth."
5584,809a902c84f8,The face didn't have any footprints around it so aliens couldn't done it.
5585,809a902c84f8,"On Earth the wind blows, and pollen from one flower goes to another."
5586,809a902c84f8,"Dirt on Mars could of blew to one area, and it could form a face."
5587,2719e2841d6f,Spacecrafts flying around Mars could have cause the face to appear.
5588,f0743fe29043,The air that is blowing out of the spacecraft could of blown the dirt into piles.
5589,f0743fe29043,Piles of dirts can form since the scapecraft is big.
5590,f0743fe29043,When the scapecraft takes off it could form the face because when air is blown out it leaves a mark.
5591,f0743fe29043,A spacecraft couldn't have left a mark by the face.
5592,f0743fe29043,The fuel on the spacecraft could of left a mark after blasting off Mars.
5593,7741dff239e1,The face on Mars could be there naturally
5594,bbd1196957d2,It is the third planet from the sun.
5595,bbd1196957d2,If there's any volcanoes; lava can explode out of it.
5596,bbd1196957d2,"Aliens wouldn't come out, and randomly make a face to scare people."
5597,bbd1196957d2,The face on Mars must be natural because I don't believe that aliens are real.
5598,bbd1196957d2,If aliens are real we probably would have seen one by now.
5599,bbd1196957d2,Aliens can't be alive; if they were alive they would have to find food sometime.
5600,a28ac27206ba,"However, the face could be have been maded by aliens."
5601,2f9fcd986df6,I'm stil shocked that people think they're real.
5602,2f9fcd986df6,I've never seen one before
5603,9028eacf00d3,"aliens could be able to fly, and they don't have to touch the ground."
5604,9028eacf00d3,"The could pick up the dirt, and place it where ever they want to form the face"
5605,22542e6f7e81,"Inconclusion I still don't believe in aliens, but something had to happen to Mars."
5606,22542e6f7e81,It could of been a natural landform or it could of been a spacecraft flying around Mars.
5607,22542e6f7e81,"They world may never know how the face was created, but I'm positive that aliens didn't create it."
5608,dcdea329cada,Would you ever want to live on another planet if humans and other life could live on it
5609,16c739ffc434,"The author well supports his idea about ""The Challange of Exploring Venus""."
5610,46703bab7a65,There would be a little chance of any human or life to live on venus
5611,b651ad11f036,On venus the planet reamins unliveable to human.
5612,b651ad11f036,"In the many times they sent spacecrafts to venus, venus had claimed the lives of the people inside the spacecraft."
5613,b651ad11f036,Since then NASA would not send another space shuttle to venus and it has been like that for 3 decades now.
5614,dc7a8ae3231e,"The planet venus also known as the ""Evening star"" is one of the brightes in the night sky."
5615,dc7a8ae3231e,Venus is also like a twin of earth the characteristics of this planet is alike except for the speed and the size.
5616,dc7a8ae3231e,A thick atmosphere of about 97% of carbon dioxide covers the planet venus.
5617,dc7a8ae3231e,When you pass that the surface of the earth is 800 degrees fahrenheit and verry deadly to any creacher that lives on earth.
5618,dc7a8ae3231e,the atmospheric pressure is 90% than what we experience here.
5619,dc7a8ae3231e,So why do scientist still study and figure out how life can form on this planet?
5620,dc7a8ae3231e,well...Scientist want to study this planet because they believe it was similar and an earth-like planet.
5621,dc7a8ae3231e,When the planet was and Earth-like planet it could have supported the life that lives on the actual earth now.
5622,dc7a8ae3231e,"On venus there were oceans,rivers,valleys,and ect."
5623,dc7a8ae3231e,could we return to this planet?
5624,dc7a8ae3231e,Scientist say that returning to earth is indisputable.
5625,dc7a8ae3231e,Scients also want to figure out how they can send people there and be successfull?
5626,dc7a8ae3231e,NASA want to design a blimp like vhical that can hover over venus without touching the unbarable ground but would give little insight of the planet.
5627,dc7a8ae3231e,Scientist could not take samples of rock or gas or anything eles.
5628,dc7a8ae3231e,Many researchers are tryin to come up with an idea so that they can get all their information on venus.
5629,f6e3c92281bf,"
All in all, the author supports the idea of the life on venus and the past with great details that backs it up."
5630,f6e3c92281bf,Also that the author wants the readers to know that giving up on something will not help you succeed but to keep working on what you are trying to achive to get something great out of it and to figure out how to bypass the obsticals.
5631,122f0b90c2ee,One day a student finds out that her principal has decided all students must participate in an extracurricular activity.
5632,122f0b90c2ee,She learns that an extracurricular activity is a club or sport that students engage in outside of school.
5633,122f0b90c2ee,"While some students say that this is a good decision, others argue that they are not interested in any of the activities available and that it will be a waste of their free time."
5634,3a699e69c44c,I agree with this decision as requiring students to participate in an extracurricular activity
5635,15fdd3940449,"will keep them occupied,"
5636,bd5084ce1326,"allow them to meet new people,"
5637,26bfee9afbe4,help them find a new hobby.
5638,944e251059ec,many students may not be physically active due to the fact that they do not have the motivation or immediate need to be.
5639,944e251059ec,"However, by joining their local soccer team they will have a reason to be active while still having fun participating."
5640,944e251059ec,Students who do not have any clubs to participate in may also attempt to fill in their free time with unsafe activities such as trying a drug or joining a gang.
5641,944e251059ec,Extracurricular activities would reduce this behavior as it will fill in this time with safe activities and help students find an interest that they can participate in for the future.
5642,96c1f723ec08,This has personally happened to me during the seventh grade.
5643,96c1f723ec08,"Crocheting has always been a hobby of mine, but I never knew many people who shared the same interest as me."
5644,96c1f723ec08,"Due to this, I had always participated in the activity alone."
5645,96c1f723ec08,"When I found out that my school had a Fiber Arts club, I joined it to see what it was like."
5646,96c1f723ec08,What I had discovered was that there where many people I knew who shared the same interest as me without my knowledge.
5647,96c1f723ec08,This resulted in me forming closer bonds with them and meeting new people who became my friends in the future.
5648,96c1f723ec08,Students should be required to participate in an extracurricular activity because a student joining a club that interests them will allow them to grow their passion while meeting new people.
5649,7593e7d3bb92,"Despite a student not having a hobby that is provided through an extracurricular activity, by joining a club they may discover a new passion."
5650,7593e7d3bb92,"For example, the Fiber Arts club I had joined also included knitting and felting activities."
5651,7593e7d3bb92,"While at first I was only focused on doing what I was comfortable with, I soon got interested in the other activities that were available."
5652,7593e7d3bb92,"Through this, I discovered new hobbies I still enjoy to this day which other students may also experience."
5653,0afc20e8df1c,"
Making extracurricular activities mandatory will be beneficial to students as it will keep them occupied, allow them to meet people who share their interests, and lead to new hobbies being discovered."
5654,0afc20e8df1c,"When students participate in extracurricular activities, it reduces risky actions they may perform out of boredom."
5655,0afc20e8df1c,"Joining a club may also lead to them meeting people with the same interests, or even discovering a new interest."
5656,0afc20e8df1c,I agree with the principal's decision of requiring the participation of extracurricular activities as it will benefit the students who participate in them.
5657,839aebc5a4ab,In The Challenge of Exploring Venus the pursuit despite the danger the author include that thar are almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide is on venus and the temperes average over 800 dergrees fahrenheit.
5658,839aebc5a4ab,NASA is telling us like how it not liveabul on venus.
5659,839aebc5a4ab,venus has the hottest suface temperature of any plantet in our solar system.
5660,839aebc5a4ab,NASA has been sening thing to Venus but the hostile conditions on the surface of venus is bad so NASA idea for sending thing to venus is having vehicl hovering 30 or so mile above the roiling landscape.
5661,839aebc5a4ab,having vehicl hovering over the landscape of venus.
5662,f70a6f53b047,The text also state even a vehicl will have so much time to hovering over venus because the light can't penetrate the dense atmosphere.
5663,f70a6f53b047,More importantly resher can't take anything because it is dense atmosphere.
5664,f70a6f53b047,Fot them to seeking any info thay would have to get up close and personal despite the risks.
5665,f70a6f53b047,Having knowledge fo venus meney researcher are working on some simplifed electronice.
5666,f70a6f53b047,The National Aeronautis and space Administration have a idea for sending humans with haveing bad condush.
5667,f70a6f53b047,At Venus temperatures would be around 170 degrees fahrenheit.
5668,f70a6f53b047,Stat frome the text researchers are working on innvations that would alloe our mechines to last longer enought to contribute meningfully to our knowedge of Venus.
5669,f70a6f53b047,NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus.
5670,7bf6762cac0b,I am a scientist at NASA who is trying to tell you that the landform you saw on mars is nothing more than just a natural landform.
5671,e73d252d5ee2,It may look like a face
5672,3a3086b3b1e0,but it is really not.
5673,192935d1de1d,"What it really is, is a natural landform that our viking took a picture of on one side of mars."
5674,bfba2a7692f4,The picture that you saw is nothing more than a picture taken at the right moment so that it makes it look like that mars has a face.
5675,bfba2a7692f4,"The reason why it looks like it has a face is because the picture was taken at the moment on when the landform had a shadow at the certain places of the landform to make it look like it has eyes,nose, and a mouth."
5676,bfba2a7692f4,If you look at the picture from 1976 you can see that it shows more of the face and that it does look like a face.
5677,bfba2a7692f4,But then if you look at the picture taken at 1998 and 2001 you can see that the natural landform on mars is starting to break up and that the shadow on it is now sarting to fade away.
5678,d2bdd9048b2a,So you won't have to worry about aliens giving out a message to us saying anything bad.
5679,d2bdd9048b2a,It's nothing more than just a natural landform and a picture taken at the right moment.
5680,e09d71f69419,It's very fun and educational to travel
5681,bcea4cc10030,"Luke was a solider in World War 1 and he was stationed in Europe,during this time war was going on and this wasn't the best time to visit there."
5682,bcea4cc10030,"But it's a more safe invorment and is known for it's history including the ""World War 1""."
5683,bcea4cc10030,"When you've had a lot going on at work, just want to do something nice for the kids,or even just tired of the weather a vaction is perfect for many reasons such as the ones I've mentioned."
5684,bcea4cc10030,It's also very easy to become stressed and overwheled by work and school;its just best to take a break for it all.
5685,bcea4cc10030,"You can just go to a beach on an tropical Island or a jungle then come back to a fresh start ready to go,before you know you'll already be planing your next trip back or somewhere esle."
5686,bcea4cc10030,You'll also get to meet new people around the world maybe you'll decide to move there.
5687,f8185d517c41,its great to travel hopfully you'll concider it
5688,2cf887842519,While student take a break from school there are teacher want student to continue to lean even their break from school.
5689,2cf887842519,Some school require student to do summer projects to assure they continue learning even during break.
5690,2cf887842519,Should these project be teacher or student designed?
5691,fd5db5cfd0a8,The Summer Project should be student designed during break.
5692,b91966fcdfb8,Why should this summer project should be student designed not teacher designed?
5693,b91966fcdfb8,If student have a choice of who came up an idea to write about they would most likely choose them self.
5694,b91966fcdfb8,This summer project due til student go back to school telling that student have lot of time to come up with an idea to write about.
5695,b91966fcdfb8,Student can come with an idea quickly because they can what they do and write about that they also can write what they do during the break
5696,b667453b07cc,Since this is student designed student can start this project anytime they want
5697,0d2d987377c9,If the student start their summer project student can be creative with their work by putting effort into it.
5698,60511dcd29fb,student can choose if they want to do it colorful and creative or plain student have a choice if they want their work all bright and pretty or simple and plain.
5699,60511dcd29fb,"If the student choose colorful and creative there work might include with picture, color, detail, and what they might do during break showing that whoever made this work put a lot of thought and effort into it."
5700,60511dcd29fb,"If the student want to be simple with their work they might include white background, all word telling what they do during break, and a lot of mess of pencil mark."
5701,60511dcd29fb,whatever they choose to be creative or not they will end up using their head to come up with these idea and student can make their project exciting or boring it up to them.
5702,28817003bf5b,If student do this summer project and let the student to do their designed it will show that student put a lot of work into their project
5703,7fc7cc64182f,The most difficult part of this project is come up with good idea to do.
5704,7fc7cc64182f,Coming up idea can be hard and stressful it show that student put a lot of thought into their work.
5705,7fc7cc64182f,"While student work on their design something they think what would be great to put into their design like color if so what kind would be best, picture if so what kind,and patter."
5706,7fc7cc64182f,After they finish student need to check if they like it or not and they have to check if they any mistake.
5707,7fc7cc64182f,When you look at the work it show student put a lot of thought in their project.
5708,1bc460b6ac4e,"Some school require student to do summer projects to assure they continue learning even during break, should these project be teacher or student designed."
5709,1bc460b6ac4e,During break the Summer Project should be student designed.
5710,1bc460b6ac4e,"student can start this project anytime they like, they can make their design exciting or boring, and show that student put a lot of effort into their work."
5711,1bc460b6ac4e,If student have a choice of teacher give idea to write about or student come up with one what would you choose?
5712,414a22350b67,"Luke took a trip with a friend and he went to may uneque places as a part of the

5714,08928f58eaa9,In the passage Luke does exactally that.
5715,5d81327805e1,"He sailed across to many places providing food, cattle and shelter for the people and animals lost there food and homes in the war."
5716,5d81327805e1,Just imagine how much you would others that had just experianced alot of pain ina war and had lost there homes and had no food to eat of no place to sleep and may have even lost friends and family.
5717,58c22416223b,In this passage Luke is also worryed about him having to go into the tmillitary because of his age and at the time you would often be shiped off to boot camps and millitary schools at the age of 18.
5718,f9bd1a639f25,The main idea of this passage is a man and Luke going to sea to help others in need of food and shelter.
5719,f9bd1a639f25,One of the many places they went where New Orleans they arrived in New Orleans in 1945 where they where told to go to and take 335 horses and food items for the hoses so they didnt die on the way to New Orleans.

5721,4460a580b29b,"Technology is every day beging more capable of new things, in terms of artificial intelligenece."
5722,4460a580b29b,The new software has been developled so that it can read or decode the emotions of others.
5723,4460a580b29b,"Dr. Eckman has classified six bassic emotions - happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness-, he assocciated each emotion with movements on the facial muscles."
5724,4460a580b29b,"It is important to know how the muscles in our body , in our face works , and what an amazing way to know through technology."
5725,4ed33ad9cc2a,"But at the point to that technology knows what are your emotions to then use them on ""what you need"" is not correct"
5726,d90249b4cee4,I am not saying that when we want to search about emotions through technology there should not be anything on it.
5727,a621e55fed81,But what if we are trying to hide emotions for our or others good and technology just cames and reads or decodes your emotions how would you feel?
5728,0c06f173cf24,"It is also important to know the basic of emotions, because that how you express yourself."

5740,c0628aa5f77f,Most astronauts from NASA are fascinated about the idea of the exploration of Venus
5741,33715acceb73,"In article it says,"" Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it way well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."
5742,33715acceb73,"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."

5744,5ded217fd1f1,There are a lot of astronauts in NASA that are willing to take on the challenge to Venus and NASA has already been simulatiing prototypes to withstand the conditions similar to Venus
5745,b04d5996c3f9,The planet is not just fascinating.
5746,b04d5996c3f9,it's also really dangerous for astronauts to travel there.
5747,b04d5996c3f9,Exploring Venus is really dangerous that no one will be able to survive with such harsh conditions the astronauts have to face

5754,b7ae024edc07,Many cause of limited car usage tends to have less people on the streets.
5755,b7ae024edc07,Near the French and Swiss borders ; streets and driveways and home garages were not allowed for free parking.
5756,b7ae024edc07,It forced people to park in places where it was usually crowded.
5757,b7ae024edc07,Most people did not like the parking rules.
5758,b7ae024edc07,They either rode their bikes or walked back and forth to get to their destination.
5759,b7ae024edc07,"Later after that, many people were very upset with the parking rules, that alot of them decided to sell their car so they could park wherever and that had opened spaces for multiple cars to transpass the roads at the same time."
5760,b7ae024edc07,"Same thing in Bogota, Columbia but the problem they had, was the pollution in the air."
5761,b7ae024edc07,Columbians rode on buses with other people because the believed it was safer than being in a car and getting in an accident.
5762,b7ae024edc07,"Paris had the same problem, except they were fined to be driving."
5763,b7ae024edc07,"About 4,000 drivers were fined and others cars were to be impounded for arguing about being fined."
5764,a6b36f69acc7,"I think the better way for the car problems, is to have all people discuss the problems and explain what is best for other people."
5765,ff9f15b87c68,The solution near French and Swiss border is to let people park wherever they like and Columbia to clean up their pollution so they can live through fresh and safer enviroment.
5766,671335812c51,"The ""Facial Action Conding System"" would be a good technique for teachers to see if the students were paying attention during class, and if they were not how could they help him improve."
5767,470d36adcf48,Using this system would be beneficial for all in the class room because they will be aware of it and if something bad happens they can see the video tape.
5768,470d36adcf48,"The system of recognizion is based to describe your emotions on certain things like as, if someone is not feeling well or if they need help with their work."

5770,470d36adcf48,"Most people will have the same face reaction all day meaning, if someone has a angry face and someone ask him if everything is ok, his respond is yes, is that his emotions and feelings do not interacts with his face reaction."

5772,470d36adcf48,Determining different emotions associated with the facial muslces can truly help teachers to ditermine basic and normal emotions but also to see mixed emotions.
5773,470d36adcf48,"As the Author says, ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal."
5774,470d36adcf48,""", this means that not everyone will demonstraste how they feel in the inside, which not all students will have the same reaction during school and classes."
5775,c3de93abd240,"In conclusion, the facial action of recognition is some how bad, because students can act different if they know that there is a digital system recording them all the time, and can be good for them to pay more attention in class."
5776,ff63922fa661,Because Venus has all proprties that humans requied to inhabit.

5778,ff63922fa661,"As the author said ""the temperature of Venus pass the 170 degress fahrentheid"", this means that humans can't resist this temperatures."
5779,ff63922fa661,"Years ago scientist fund something interesting in Venus but also dangereous, venus can be inhabit??"
5780,ff63922fa661,"?, how we can travel to Venus???"

5783,ff63922fa661,"Scientis fund that Venus maybe can be inhabit, because they fund properties that Earth posees."
5784,ff63922fa661,"But now Venus is like pangea, a dangerous planet with dangerous gasees, earthquakes, etc."
5785,ff63922fa661,"and now, the humanity want to know how to lived in Venus."
5786,9bdd2ecf7319,"Venus is a planet that we can study, survived etc."
5787,9bdd2ecf7319,"But also it take a lot of time to do programs and prepare the people, also we are close to put the first step on Venus."
5788,9bdd2ecf7319,thank you....
5789,4cbd301cdeb4,"Summer break for students can be a very extensive time period, and during this time students tend to halt the learning process."
5790,4cbd301cdeb4,"Consequently, select schools require students to complete a summer project to ensure they do not stop learning over the long break."
5791,4cbd301cdeb4,"The projects can be assigned by the teacher or chosen by the student, this varies depending on what the teacher wants you to do."
5792,4cbd301cdeb4,"Upon receiving a Teacher-designed project, students will all have to complete the same project opposed to student-designed projects where the project is innovated by the student and it is most probable to see a majority of students with vastly different projects."
5793,e0465eb37bbb,"If I were to have to complete a summer project, I would want it to be a teacher-designed project."
5794,183503946997,executing a teacher-designed project would be less stressful than it would be opposed to it being student-designed.
5795,f9213f229f8f,"When a teacher assigns you a project, it has more than likely been executed in the past."
5796,f9213f229f8f,"for that reason, it will undoubtedly make researching for the project go a lot smoother than it would if you are researching something that has never been done."
5797,f9213f229f8f,"During the summer break, students are busy playing video games, relaxing at the beach, and hanging out with friends, with that being said it will be less stressful to just carry out a project you have been assigned, instead of having to spend time brainstorming."
5798,f9213f229f8f,"Not only do you have to discover the project in general from scratch when doing a student-designed project, but you have ponder about how you are going to conduct the project itself, and this process can take days off of students precious summer break."
5799,e197fbee4bd0,"one students self innovated project will be different from another, leaving no opportunity to get support from other classmates."
5800,d37c55df8246,"Conducting a teacher-designed project will give you the opportunity to share ideas with fellow classmates, for the reason that you will all be working on the same project."
5801,d37c55df8246,Teacher-designed projects also give light to the idea of having a partner.
5802,88ecd1380ead,"Organization is another viable issue,"
5803,804c5c70dff5,with a student-designed project you may get confused about how to carry out the project leaving it potentially incomplete or sloppy.
5804,804c5c70dff5,"On the other hand, if you are doing a teacher-designed project instructions will likely be clearer and you have will likely get a grading rubric to follow."
5805,216b6c58184e,"Some opposed to this may say, ""I do not want to do a summer project anyways, therefore let me choose the topic""."
5806,216b6c58184e,"I agree that the topic of the project may be more interesting if it is student-designed,"
5807,63b38e1defcf,but if the project is teacher-designed you will learn more.
5808,63b38e1defcf,Student designed-projects will not test the brain as much as a project that they know nothing about will.
5809,63b38e1defcf,"Moreover, students will be put to the test more if they have to research something that is beyond logic."
5810,63b38e1defcf,Even though you will learn more doing a teacher-designed project it still the easier option.
5811,63b38e1defcf,"For that reason, teacher-designed projects are the better fit because the whole point of making students do a summer break project is to ensure that they learn as much as possible."
5812,175be662c1b6,although student-designed projects are helpful the teacher should be the one innovating these summer projects.
5813,175be662c1b6,Teacher-designed projects accomplish both being the least stressful and being the least tedious.
5814,175be662c1b6,"In that light, they should undoubtedly be the way summer break projects are conducted."
5815,175be662c1b6,"This summer break if students have to do projects it should be a teacher-designed project, not only for the benefit of the students but the teacher will also be able to grade the projects easier because all of the projects should be similar."
5816,175be662c1b6,"To sum it all up, Teacher-designed projects are the clear winner, therefore if I ever have to do a summer project that is the way I would want it."
5817,b04af630947f,The face on mars was first found by the spacecraft called Viking one and was cirling mars when it found the face.
5818,b04af630947f,alot of people belive it is a real artifact.
5819,e2060d216b21,NASA has took more pictures to prove that it is infact not an artifact.
5820,33061f26611d,People belive there just covering it up so pople wont know about it.
5821,6f14716a136b,But that is not true it would benifit NASA if it were an true artifact.
5822,aeaf72767ccb,The face on mars is just a lndform
5823,00821551d0ca,because of the pictures we took we could not see and form of building structure.
5824,00821551d0ca,one thing that brings me to this conclusion is the rocks and shadows made it look and seem very real.
5825,00821551d0ca,"The text states ""...formed by shadows..."""
5826,ebbd533531f6,Tv and other things are what is drawing the attention to the matter andthey are whats broadcasting to the world that it is real.
5827,ebbd533531f6,"The text states "" It starred in a hollywood film , appeared in books , magazines, radio talk shows..."""
5828,c17da9933400,This brings me to the conclusion that infact it is not real but was made real by televison and other things.
5829,c17da9933400,People just dontt wanna listen to the since behind it.
5830,c17da9933400,If it where in fact real it would benifit NASA.
5831,e3c2a5bd863f,Cell phones have become very popular over the past years when it comes to texting and driving.
5832,60168b87b647,The behavior is very dangerous and causes death do to not paying attention to the road
5833,b37a7c97797b,They cause more crashes day by day.
5834,d5882fe83d25,Then eventually this led to enforcement by the police of when you are caught texting and driving you will get a ticket
5835,2aabe7c99794,This hurts victim family members by your mistake of texting and driving and killing the innocent.
5836,3fac70db9483,"The number one reason why people don't use a cellphone why driving, because its causes car crashes."
5837,3c565edfdee3,You have to keep your eyes on the road at all time or it will lead to jail time!!!
5838,3c565edfdee3,Driving under the age of 18 is illegal in most states.
5839,3c565edfdee3,Another way that its dangerous is if you are drinking and driving.
5840,3c565edfdee3,Which means that more people or dying each and other day.
5841,3c565edfdee3,Reports have that 1.6 million crashes are caused because drivers text while driving.
5842,832c55029831,People sometimes might argue with the fact they can multi-task well
5843,4d0ffc425767,but that doesn't change the fact that many of teens and adults are at risk when you're behind the wheel.
5844,3dbbd03a06fd,The number of deaths increase everyday do to drinking and driving as well.
5845,3dbbd03a06fd,There is a specific time you can drive after drinking which is 5 hours to sure you're ok to drive without causing a crash.
5846,3dbbd03a06fd,Which makes thousands of people dangerous drivers everyday fights the public!!
5847,3dbbd03a06fd,!
5848,a64e8e75a1c7,In conclusion texting and driving at the same time is putting yourself and others at risk because both yawl could lose your lives in a blink of an eye!

5850,8c5b6748fdf5,"The ""Face on Mars"" was found during a search for a possible landing site for the sister ship of Viking 1,

Pictures were taken during the search, a showy likeness of a human face was spotted."
5851,8c5b6748fdf5,"An enourmous head close to two miles from end to end, was looking back at the camera."
5852,8c5b6748fdf5,"Scientists believed it was just another Martian mesa, common around a region of Mars called Cydonia."
5853,8c5b6748fdf5,But it had unusual shadows that made it look similar to an Egypt Pharaoh.
5854,8c5b6748fdf5,"The ""Face on Mars"" is a huge rock formation, which resembles a human head."
5855,8c5b6748fdf5,"Shadows gave the illusion of eyes, a nose, and a mouth, and because of this, it caused alot of attention to Mars."
5856,8c5b6748fdf5,"People believe that it was an alien monument, but proof showed that it was, just a natural landform."
5857,59acf36594fa,Few Scientists believe the Face was an alien artifact.
5858,59acf36594fa,Photographing Cydonia and the Face became a priorty for NASA.
5859,59acf36594fa,"Eighteen years after the Viking missions ended, Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September, 1997."
5860,59acf36594fa,"On April 5, 1998 Mars Global Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time, Michael Malin, and his Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) team took a photo ten times sharper than the original Viking Photos in 1976."
5861,59acf36594fa,Thousands of web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL web site.
5862,59acf36594fa,"To no surprise at all, revealed ."
5863,59acf36594fa,. . a natural landform.
5864,59acf36594fa,"No alien monument after all, Just rocks."
5865,59acf36594fa,When the photo was taken it was winter in April '98.
5866,59acf36594fa,A cloudy time of year on the Red Planet.
5867,59acf36594fa,"The camera on board MGS had to look through wispy clouds to see the Face, skeptics believe that because of this the alien markings were hidden."
5868,59acf36594fa,"As said in the article

""Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maxium resolution."""
5869,59acf36594fa,The pixels in the 2001 image spans to 1.56 meters.
5870,59acf36594fa,While the best 1976 Viking photo had 43 meters per pixel.
5871,59acf36594fa,"In a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, if there were objects on the ground in this picture, you could see what they were just by looking at it."
5872,59acf36594fa,"The picture shows the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, commonly found around the American West."
5873,59acf36594fa,"""It reminds me of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,"" says Garvin ""That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."""
5874,2fab8fb6257f,"In the year 1976, when Viking 1 space craft was taking photographs of possiable landing spots for Viking 2 spacecraft, they found a formation in a rock that looked like a human face."
5875,2fab8fb6257f,"The shadows made the rock look like it had a nose, mouth, and two eyes, like a human."
5876,2fab8fb6257f,This was found in a region of the Red Planet called Cydonia.
5877,2fab8fb6257f,"The ""Head"" was nearly two miles from end to end, and it seemed to be starring back at the cameras."
5878,2fab8fb6257f,"The controllers back at the Jet Propulsion Lab were probably quite surprised when this face popped up on their screens, looking them right in the eyes."
5879,2fab8fb6257f,This sensation was short lived.
5880,2fab8fb6257f,"Scientist figured it was just another Martian mesa, which was common around Cydonia."
5881,2fab8fb6257f,The only difference with this one is it had unusal shadows that made it seem like an Egyptian Pharaoh.
5882,2fab8fb6257f,A few days later NASA unveiled the image for the public eye to see.
5883,2fab8fb6257f,"The caption on this picture was ""Huge rock formation... which resembles a human head.... formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes,nose and a mouth."""
5884,2fab8fb6257f,NASA'S reasoning was that the picture would help engage public attraction to Mars.
5885,2fab8fb6257f,This public picture was soon a pop icon.
5886,2fab8fb6257f,"It starred in Hollywood films, was in books, magazines, talk shows on the radio, and even haunted grogery store checkout lines for over 25 years."
5887,2fab8fb6257f,Some people think that this picture is evidence of life on Mars.
5888,2fab8fb6257f,Conspiracy theorist say that this is information NASA would rather hide.
5889,2fab8fb6257f,"Defenders of the NASA budget wish that there was life on Mars, as this would make NASA more popular, and even richer, when people use the picture in books, movies, magazines, and more."
5890,2fab8fb6257f,"Although most scientist believed the face was an alien artifact, photographing Cydonia became a priority to NASA, when Mars Global Surveyor arrived at the Red Planet eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."
5891,2fab8fb6257f,"Jim Garvin, cheif scientist, said that they felt like it was a right of taxpayers to see photographs of the face as soon as possiable."
5892,2fab8fb6257f,"On April 5, 1998, Michael Malin snapped a photograph ten times sharper then the old one."
5893,2fab8fb6257f,"This became popular with web surfers, as they were waiting for the first photo to show up on a JPL website."
5894,2fab8fb6257f,"Only this picture showed what they were not wanting, a natural landform."
5895,2fab8fb6257f,This was not an alien momument after all.
5896,2fab8fb6257f,"While most people were satisfied, others were not."
5897,2fab8fb6257f,They still think that NASA is still hiding evidence of an alien momument.
5898,2fab8fb6257f,The Face on Mars is located at 41 degrees north martian latitude where it was winter in April 1998.
5899,2fab8fb6257f,The camera on board MGS had to peer though whispy clouds to see it.
5900,2fab8fb6257f,"Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden behind clouds on purpose, so that humans would not be able to see them."
5901,2fab8fb6257f,Mission controls planned to take another photograph of it.
5902,2fab8fb6257f,"It is not easy work, and it is not easy to target Cydonia."
5903,2fab8fb6257f,They just do not pass the face very often.
5904,2fab8fb6257f,"Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Cydonia, MGS drew close enough for a second veiw."
5905,2fab8fb6257f,They had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the face in the field of view.
5906,2fab8fb6257f,They used the cameras highest resolution.
5907,2fab8fb6257f,"Each pixel in the 2001 image spans at 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Vikings photo."
5908,2fab8fb6257f,"""As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image three times bigger than the pixel size."
5909,2fab8fb6257f,"So if there were objects on the ground such as airplanes or Egyptian-style pyramids or even small shacks, you could have seen what they were"" Said Jim Garvin."
5910,2fab8fb6257f,"What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa, which are landforms that are common around the American West."
5911,2fab8fb6257f,"""It reminds me of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho"" Says Garvin."
5912,2fab8fb6257f,"""Thats a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height of the Face on Mars."""
5913,2fab8fb6257f,He added.
5914,ed286398b719,"So weather or not theFace is an alien landform or a rock formation, NASA does wish it was an alien landform, just to bring pupiclatiy to the Red Planet."
5915,4a314292d625,"However, it is highly imposable for it to be an alien momument, as they would have to have oxygen to survive,and they would have to find plenty of food and water to also survive."
5916,571d9de5c5a8,New technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.
5917,571d9de5c5a8,Hold on!
5918,571d9de5c5a8,"Can we actually ""calculate"" emoitons---like math homework?"
5919,571d9de5c5a8,And how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel?
5920,571d9de5c5a8,"Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit""."
5921,82bef26f4a7f,"In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."
5922,82bef26f4a7f,"For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on his or her face."
5923,82bef26f4a7f,"Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy, worried, ect."
5924,82bef26f4a7f,His new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.
5925,82bef26f4a7f,"Perhaps Dr. Huang's emotion algorithms are a different sort of of ""Da Vinci Code""!"
5926,3d58a99e0758,I'm for the new technology Facial Action Coding System
5927,3584438a5d77,"I think is a good idea for computers to know if there owner is happy, mad, sad, and ect"
5928,7df30e4b5734,"Heres a qoute from the article "" even thought individuals often show varying degrees of expression"" (like not smiling as broadly)."
5929,7df30e4b5734,Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).
5930,d17beb6b3d79,"I disagree, because some times there is nothing there that interest"
5931,db0c982244ca,Many schools dont have a program that people like.
5932,db0c982244ca,So if they force some one to do something that they dont like it could make them frustrated.
5933,2f39e24ef051,There is something good to it.
5934,2f39e24ef051,It can make them try new stuff.
5935,c9168850870b,It can get them interested new jobs they can try.
5936,c9168850870b,A new future they can try to achieve.
5937,c9168850870b,it could also make them a more interesting person.
5938,c9168850870b,More possible people talk to about the topic.
5939,c9168850870b,But they could despise the topic.
5940,cd5624338c72,Than forcing them in to it could make the hate it more.
5941,7810d8593db3,There could be some personal stuff that do's not let them join a club.
5942,7810d8593db3,some personal trauma that makes them less likely to join a club.
5943,7810d8593db3,it could also be that they just dont want to do it.
5944,7810d8593db3,Being part of a sports team is also very physically demanding.
5945,d868caac10fc,There is always chance they could not make it on the team
5946,2a0f1ee9938a,Plus there is always a chance of being kicked out of the club or team.
5947,2a0f1ee9938a,Plus if you try a sport out and figure out that you dont like it you can always quit.
5948,2a0f1ee9938a,There is always a chance that the club could not even help you in the real world.
5949,2a0f1ee9938a,There could be no real world implication
5950,8570bcc2a365,some times people could like try new things out.
5951,8570bcc2a365,People could also no like change in their schedule.
5952,8570bcc2a365,Forcing stuff on people isnt the best option.
5953,8570bcc2a365,There is always a chance they might like the club.
5954,8570bcc2a365,You might make some new friends.
5955,c9b9047b0eb8,The author gives good reasonings on why the idea of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers
5956,b1c5046f53f8,"The first reasoning that the author has is that way back when, Venus might have had open oceans and could have supported various forms of life."
5957,4908f685ae55,"Just like Earth does, the planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar feartures such as moutains, valleys, and craters."
5958,80c96f9a127a,NASA has an exquisset idea for sending humans to study Venus
5959,0f6ef982b3c0,"Just picture an enormous blimp-like contraption that hovers 30 or so miles above all of the landscapes, all of the storms, we would be care free."
5960,0f6ef982b3c0,"Nothing to worry about except for the drastic temperatures of 170 degrees Fahrenheit that we all would still have to endure while we're there, but no worries we could always just fan eachother with a paper fan."
5961,8cf15e4027b0,It 'll work the same I'm sure.
5962,8cf15e4027b0,"We would have solar powered appliences so we wouldn't have to sorry about the everyday hassal of having to plug in, detangle, of trip over any more cords."
5963,8cf15e4027b0,"This would be a major change for all of us drastic in fact, but still survivable."
5964,8cf15e4027b0,NASA has had some simpified electronics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in a chamber simulated the Venus's surface and has lasted for three weeks in such harsh and mild conditions
5965,4883c3c7e6fe,NASA would be making our living situations a lot easier to handle of Venus by creating all of this new technology today in this age/era
5966,736f5230003f,"In clonclusion, NASA has outstanding creations that would be outstandingly suitable for the human race to live on Venus."
5967,736f5230003f,"Worry free, hardly any bills to pay, and all liveable cercumstances."
5968,736f5230003f,Also that the author's idea of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite of all of the dangers that come with The planet.
5969,a09fb10a981e,i don't think its a bad way to test it i say they should test it to one classroom see how it works see what it can do
5970,541f0ed9e57b,"so if you ever want to put theses in classroom's give it to one class to try them out and if they like it use but if they don't u can't do anything but make something better or something just like give it a diffenert name and shape, and size stuff like that beacuse you don't want to give it to a person that dose not like the idea of using it."
5971,541f0ed9e57b,say you have three classroom's and u want to see what's the odds of these classroom's using these so you test them for like 3 weeks see how use it see if they like do they need help using them so i think it would be great to have in classrooms as long as they like them and know's how to use them is the biggest part of this new product.
5972,0f0c5fb10e0e,"My name is Proffesor Yado, and my colleague and I were discussing on the infamous ""Face on Mars""."
5973,0f0c5fb10e0e,My colleague believes in superstition and conspiracies so he stated that the face on Mars must be of extraterrestrial origin.
5974,0f0c5fb10e0e,"I said that was porposterous, but my colleague continued to try and convince me to no availe."
5975,aa0308d502bd,"I told my colleague there are many reasons why the some scientists and people thought the ""Face on Mars"" looked like a face."
5976,aa0308d502bd,I then procedded to tell him my reasons.
5977,62bc82c3270a,"First off, cameras at the time were not as advanced as they are today."
5978,62bc82c3270a,"The cameras of the day would ""distort the image and it would only capture the major features of the butte or mesa."
5979,c9151ba16b17,"The most recent image taken of the ""Face on Mars"" in 2001 looks very different from the original image taken in 1976."
5980,c9151ba16b17,"If there was a actual structure left by aliens, modern cameras would be able to see it."
5981,c9151ba16b17,The the more modern cameras of today are able to see the more defining features of a object.
5982,be83cb6dac05,Secondly humans are remarkably good at seeing faces when there is not one there.
5983,3f4ee5e5082e,When you look at a wall socket you can see what resembles a face when there is not one there.
5984,3f4ee5e5082e,"It is the same thing with the ""Face on Mars""."
5985,3f4ee5e5082e,"With the aid of shadows from the Sun, are ability to see faces when none are there, and the angle the picture was taken, the butte or mesa looks remarkably like a face or some alien made structure."
5986,8032ca30698a,In response to what I said my colleague had some things to say to try and disprove me.
5987,8032ca30698a,Due to my colleague believing in superstition and conspiracies he believed NASA and the government are hiding the truth from us.
5988,f9161a000d53,He stated they were hiding this from us because of what happened with H.G.
5989,f9161a000d53,"Wells The War of the Worlds, which caused a massive panic."
5990,f9161a000d53,The government don't want another mass panic so they have been keeping us away from the truth that aliens exist.
5991,f9161a000d53,My colleague also stated that possibly alien markings were hidden by haze as some other theorists thing so.
5992,1b6e5f9ae50d,I thought that was perpostourous but my colleague still believed the theory of aliens existing.
5993,b1274c53a0de,"Even thoug hmy colleague still believes in the ""Face on Mars"" to be a alien made structure."
5994,b1274c53a0de,I still believe it's only a butte or mesa.
5995,b1274c53a0de,"With my evindence of the ""Face on Mars"" only looking like a face due to the techonology of the time, the shadows of the sun, the angle the picture was taken, and our ability to see faces when none are there, I believe I have conclusive evidence that the ""Face on Mars is nothing but a butte or mesa."
5996,143c2b105729,There was no technology back when the Mona Lisa was made.
5997,143c2b105729,They had pictures and the picture showed emotion.
5998,143c2b105729,There are some people that can see the emotions of people and some are herd to see then others.
5999,3afd16a3087c,They are making technology to read the emotional expressions and that it knowns when your lieing.
6000,3cb1f11079c8,"There are pictures that show emotion,"
6001,b36245137a0d,"people that see other peoples emotion,"
6002,f991aac8088f,and now there making technology that reads emotional expressions.
6003,cdcaa7a43a69,"First, of there are pictures of people and there always will be."
6004,cdcaa7a43a69,In those pictures you can see someones emotion and how someone is feeling.
6005,6120a63977c4,Back then they only had pictures to see.
6006,6120a63977c4,"From theose pictures most artist and people could see peoples emotions, but it was meanly the artist that could read someones emotion."
6007,6120a63977c4,The artist could see throw someones fake smile or if it was real.
6008,6120a63977c4,That's why there pictures showed how many emotion she had.
6009,2f70df45c724,"Next, there are some people that can read others emotion and for it's hard or they can see them."
6010,df454430050a,Everybody is different most people that read somebody's emotion is because there a love one or a every good friend and they can read your emotion.
6011,df454430050a,There is just other people that don't care.
6012,df454430050a,"Most people should be able to see if your angry, sad or happy."
6013,df454430050a,"Those emotions are easy to see, kids show it all the time even when there not feeling so good."
6014,8d9bf00756d2,"Finaly, there is technology being made that reads someones emotion."
6015,8d9bf00756d2,The technology even know's when it is a lie.
6016,b5daeba38871,So somebody can just take a picture of somebody and there emotion.
6017,b5daeba38871,There is going to be a person that lie's the technology.
6018,b5daeba38871,Technology isn't going to make you feel better.
6019,b5daeba38871,"That person is going to need a love one or a close friend, to help them ou"
6020,6aa7d30df30f,There always going to be somebody close by that will help you out.
6021,6aa7d30df30f,Could be throw a picture and that could help you.
6022,6aa7d30df30f,"Or a friends that sees you happy, sad, or mad."
6023,6aa7d30df30f,"The technology might tell them there emotion, but wont help them out."
6024,6aa7d30df30f,"There are pictures that show emotion, people that see other peoples emotion, and now there making technology that reads peoples emotional expressions."
6025,fa3322609fb2,What do you like to do after school?
6026,fa3322609fb2,The answer is probably go home and relax.
6027,fa3322609fb2,But wouldn't it be great if everyone did an extracurricular activity
6028,f2c86852f8b7,Their is so much fun and exciting things to do other than just go home and relax for the rest of the day.
6029,f2c86852f8b7,I think kids should have to do extracurricular activities
6030,c1612cbe1f3f,because you make new friends
6031,9002bcca94a0,you help out your school
6032,1d533e7189c0,it creates other opportunities
6033,842e463906b1,While doing extracurricular activities you can make new friends
6034,6da901820db7,"Making new friends is bound to happen while doing extracurricular activities, you and another person are just going to click and get along with each other very well."
6035,6da901820db7,Making friends with the people that do the same extracurricular as you can have a lot of benefits.
6036,6da901820db7,Take this for example; I play football and my friend Generic_name doesn't.
6037,6da901820db7,"So when I try telling Generic_name about the struggles that I am going through on the football team or something important about the team, he can't help me with my problem because he is not involved."
6038,6da901820db7,"But, if I have a friend on the team then he can help me with my problems and I can also help with his or her problems."
6039,6da901820db7,"Overall, extracurricular activities help make friends that can help you through things."
6040,a7f4bb966e0d,Some extracurricular activities help out the school and the community a lot.
6041,1b15e3c96b29,It may be in a small way but it still helps.
6042,1b15e3c96b29,Groups that make the yearbook or students that serve on the student council are helping the school out.
6043,1b15e3c96b29,They are helping to keep the school in order and to keep students happy.
6044,1b15e3c96b29,"Other extracurricular activities like football and basketball help their school and community by winning games this helps the school make money, it helps the community by providing entertainment."
6045,1b15e3c96b29,"Some schools even have environmental clubs that help the school, the community, and even the world."
6046,1b15e3c96b29,"All in all, extracurricular activities help the school and community."
6047,24a80dd58929,When doing extracurricular activities you might find out that you are really good at something.
6048,24a80dd58929,People that are good at sports often get scholarships to play sports in college.
6049,24a80dd58929,You might write a school news paper and find out that you are a really good writer and could possibly become a writer or find another job that involves writing.
6050,24a80dd58929,Also doing these extracurricular activities will go on your resume and help you get into college.
6051,24a80dd58929,Extracurricular activities create so many opportunities it is outstanding.
6052,31c1f02ffb47,extracurricular activities have a lot of benefits.
6053,31c1f02ffb47,"They can help you make friends, help your school and community, and create new opportunities."

6055,99ec7a3e4e08,I think that the author describes how technolgoy called Facial Action Coding System enables computer to idntify human emotions and expressions of the students in the classroom are valuable.
6056,351f35cf0deb,"For example at the begging the line "" imagine being able to detect exactly how other people are feeling, even when they are trying to hide their emotions."""
6057,351f35cf0deb,Catches people attention
6058,751ffa1d7630,"Another example that the author used that was included that was good was in paragrah one when it states that ""Shes 83 percent happy, 9percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."
6059,751ffa1d7630,This shows that the author included logos in his paragrah another way of having a valuable short.
6060,d85fb9fc13c9,Third example has pathos catching peoples feelings or making them think being put into someone els shoes.
6061,c47818a64097,Hold on!
6062,c47818a64097,"can we actually ""calculate""emotions-like math homework?"
6063,c47818a64097,"and how can a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express how we feel""."
6064,c47818a64097,The author also gave us examples of looking in the mirror.
6065,c47818a64097,I think that the author gave details examples for the student to having in the classroom.
6066,0f714a0b33e9,Driver good is very important for all people.
6067,0f714a0b33e9,In the united states' there are  much car and this provoke much accidents in the life of the people.
6068,0f714a0b33e9,"The president Obama's say: in the united states' greenhouse gas emissions, unveiled last week, will get a fortuitous assist from an incipient shift in american behavior: recent studies suggest that americans are buying fewer cars, driving less and getting fewer licenses as each year goes by."
6069,0f714a0b33e9,"In the united states peaked in 2005 and dropped steadily thereafter, according to an analysis by doug short of advisor perspectives, an investment research company."
6070,0f714a0b33e9,As april 2013 the nombers of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995.
6071,0f714a0b33e9,"Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession,because cash-strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway."
6072,0f714a0b33e9,"''I think means something more fundamental is going on''.The transportation is the second largest source of Ameica's emissions, just behind power plants."
6073,0f714a0b33e9,But it could have negative implications for thr car industry.
6074,0f714a0b33e9,"Diferent things are converging which suggest that we are witnessing a long -term cultural shift, said Mimi Sheller, a sociology professor at drexel university and director of its mobilities research and policy center."
6075,0f714a0b33e9,She cities various factors:the internet makes telecommuting possible feel more connected without driving to meet friends.
6076,0f714a0b33e9,The precident Obama is very good with the country because this words what he say ser very important for the all people and the world.
6077,d216e0232501,"In paragraph 4 it says ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with Oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."
6078,d216e0232501,"The author also states that, Today, Venus still has some features hat are analogous to these on Earth."
6079,d216e0232501,"The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, maountains, and craters."
6080,d216e0232501,"They recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, but a crucial consideration given the long time frames of space travel."
6081,d216e0232501,"In paragraph 5 it informs us that NASA says, that the visit would not have easy conditions, but survuvable for humans."
6082,d216e0232501,"In paragraph 1 the author tells us that, Venus, sometimes called the ""Evening Star,"" si one of the brightest points of light in the sky, easy even for an amateur stargazer to spot."
6083,d216e0232501,"Although, this nickname is misleading since Venus is actually a planet."
6084,d216e0232501,The author also claims that Venus is the second planet from our sun.
6085,d216e0232501,It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely.
6086,d216e0232501,"Also referred to as Earth's ""twin,"" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, occasionally the closest in distance too."
6087,d216e0232501,"The author also says ""Earth, Venus, Mars, our other plaetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds."
6088,d216e0232501,"These differences in speed mean that sometimes we are closer to Mars and other times to Venus."""
6089,d216e0232501,"He also states that Venus is sometimes right arounf the corner, in space terms."
6090,d216e0232501,"In paragraph 2 the author claims ""Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challening planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."""
6091,d216e0232501,He also states that NASA has sent numerous spacecrafts to land on this cloud- draped world.
6092,d216e0232501,"Each previous mission was unmanned, and for a good reason, since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."
6093,d216e0232501,"Maybe this issue explains why not a single spacecraft has touched down on Venus more than three decades ago."""
6094,d216e0232501,But NASA is still studying how they could get a better way to study Venus.
6095,e57cefa5a0a7,I entered a program before called the seagoing cowboys how it all started though was because of my friend don reist.
6096,e57cefa5a0a7,I was working two part time jobs at a grocery store and a bank and when my friend invited me to go to Europe on a cattle boat.
6097,e57cefa5a0a7,I got to travel a lot to.
6098,7dbbe4466737,I am asking you to join the program just like I did.
6099,ab7b8d6fe5e7,"(UNRRA hired seagoing cowboys to take care of the horses,youngcows,and mules that were shipped overseas.)"
6100,4cf92bc017a4,That means you would get to help out other countries and their disasters.
6101,6249b31b77fd,you get to travel all kinds of places in the world
6102,1ee8ca897d3b,"Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China."
6103,1ee8ca897d3b,"But seeing the acroplis in Greece was special""."
6104,1ee8ca897d3b,he says)which he is actually me
6105,7a4f4ba73c40,"also found time to have fun on board,"
6106,db34a82db2d6,especially on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.
6107,db34a82db2d6,The cowboys played baseball and volleyball games in the empty hold where animals had been housed.
6108,db34a82db2d6,"Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling, and games also helped pass time.)"
6109,876b7682e312,So there are 3 reasons that I wrote out of why you should be a seagoing cowboy and if your a girl I suppose you could be a seagoing cowgirl.
6110,876b7682e312,Now I am not forcing you to but just convincing you and I hope that convinced you because all of it is really true.
6111,876b7682e312,So if you don't want to that's fine but if you do Great I didn't write all of that for nothing!
6112,b5d82a5f0eaa,The way that i see it is that the author put a lot of reseach into venus and study it
6113,67209a94f734,some scientist still today though study the plant.
6114,67209a94f734,And trying to find a way to go there but the tests that there getting back isnt good
6115,37bc5043e1da,"like how in the article it said that ""no space craft survived the landing for more than a few hours ""."
6116,221b6d719ab2,So as there doing more tests they find out more things about the plant and try to look for a way to reach venus and to finally land on it .
6117,221b6d719ab2,And to find out more stuff about venus up close .
6118,210e797a8165,"The other thing is they found out about venus is that "" a thick atomsphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets venus"" according to the article"
6119,9b43216a936d,And so that means that they also have to find out whats wrong with the air and how can they live in it
6120,fc2a1fd11303,And venus it the hottest plant even though mercury closer to the sun
6121,136fabba174a,venus wont really be safe for us .
6122,d9ffe5d9d19c,But therefore scientists cant get close to venus cause of the plants but they will try to chance even though there a risk.
6123,d9ffe5d9d19c,They still though want to so that they can test the objects on the plant .
6124,d9ffe5d9d19c,And see if its safe for the future or something .
6125,783f568b890e,"I think people should participate in the Seagoing Cowboys program,"
6126,902b906bc311,you can have a lot of fun.
6127,18d2b56d5f42,You will have lots of fun and get to do rodeo on some cows yeha.
6128,18d2b56d5f42,You can ride those big horses and go really fast.
6129,af1245347f92,I went to a program kinda like this before and rode big horses and fished and rode boats.
6130,af1245347f92,I got to playin the mud and it was funny and felt really weird.
6131,af1245347f92,I went in swamps and saw some gators but nun in bad.
6132,af1245347f92,I even got to see my uncle PROPER_NAME deer is cow out of the farm.

6136,013d58915f67,"Fish, crab, spaghetti , gators, rabbits, squarles, and shrimp."
6137,013d58915f67,That food is the best food in the world.
6138,013d58915f67,You can eat anywhere you like.
6139,013d58915f67,Bring your friends family anyone and enjoy that great food.

6142,1b49aa3d88ba,Don't worry though because it be extra warm in there.
6143,1b49aa3d88ba,I enjoyed the last time I slept in a cabin.
6144,1b49aa3d88ba,I slept a few nights and then one night I heard monster creeping on me and I peed down my leg.
6145,8371fb4e09f7,I really think you will want to go to that camp with the Cowboys.
6146,8371fb4e09f7,It will be really great and you get to ride horses and eat amazing food and sleep in a cabin.
6147,8371fb4e09f7,If you love to camp and go crazy then this is where you need to come.
6148,8371fb4e09f7,The Seagoing Cowboys.

6151,f1266a15769c,These people travel for long time at time sol you'll be there for awhile.
6152,8d6c1d80cd13,Everyone in life has been forced to do something that he or she does not want to do.
6153,8d6c1d80cd13,"No matter how hard the individual tried to get out of it, the individual still had to go through with the assignment."
6154,8d6c1d80cd13,"To complete the assignment, he or she will have to give up something."
6155,8d6c1d80cd13,"For example, if someone was forced to come in to work on a day off, he or she may have to give up spending time with family."
6156,8d6c1d80cd13,Being forced to do something is never a fun experience.
6157,80ae67a418fb,Students should not be required to participate in an extracurricular activity
6158,e73d48995ae0,"some may not be interested,"
6159,3a30db5c30ef,"some may not have transportation,"
6160,8fe679180f86,students may begin to stress.
6161,28bcb5792ab7,Participating in clubs or groups are not for everybody.
6162,28bcb5792ab7,"If a student does not desire to participate in an extracurricular activity, he or she should not have to."
6163,28bcb5792ab7,"If the student is forced to, he or she may not do any work."
6164,28bcb5792ab7,"For example, a student was forced to participate in an after school club."
6165,28bcb5792ab7,"During the club, the student would talk out and misbehave."
6166,28bcb5792ab7,The student was disrespectful to the club leader and acted in a disorderly manner.
6167,28bcb5792ab7,"When asked, the student replied, ""I was forced to be here."""
6168,28bcb5792ab7,"If students are required to participate in an extracurricular activity, a student may not do any work out of a lack of interest."
6169,440ab7a2c4de,This may happen because the student's parent could be busy.
6170,440ab7a2c4de,A lot of parents have to work late.
6171,440ab7a2c4de,They don't have suitable hours that will allow them to pick up or drop off their child at school.
6172,440ab7a2c4de,There have been countless times when students would stand outside waiting to be picked up from an after school activity.
6173,440ab7a2c4de,The students would stand outside for a long period of time.
6174,440ab7a2c4de,Standing outside without adult supervision can be dangerous for a student.
6175,440ab7a2c4de,A parent should not have to worry about getting his or her child home safely because the child was required to stay after school.
6176,222ae016d4de,Some extracurricular clubs and groups require students to conduct a lot of work outside the club or group.
6177,222ae016d4de,"In situations like this, students tend to worry about completing all work for their part of the group."
6178,222ae016d4de,"For instance, students have different levels of productivity."
6179,222ae016d4de,Some can balance out school work and extracurricular work while others are not able to.
6180,222ae016d4de,"If a student does not have high productivity, this may cause him or her to stress about all the work."
6181,222ae016d4de,"While trying to balance out all this work, the students grades may begin to drop."
6182,222ae016d4de,This can lead to even more stress than the student can handle.
6183,222ae016d4de,Schools should not require students to participate in an extracurricular activity because some may begin to stress.
6184,e82d3bfe674f,Students should not be forced to participate in an extracurricular activity because some may not be interested and may not have a means of transportation.
6185,e82d3bfe674f,A student may also have trouble balancing out extracurricular work and school work.
6186,e82d3bfe674f,"Though at the end of the day, everyone has his or her own purpose in life."
6187,e82d3bfe674f,It may be to do big things or some may want to do small things.
6188,e82d3bfe674f,It is not fair to be forced to do something that an individual may not want to do.
6189,e82d3bfe674f,Students have the right to choose their own path in life and to express themselves as they please.

6192,3bf449c98f89,The faicl action coding seems like a good idea.
6193,2977228082d3,My claim is that it would be cool to go into a classroom and be able to tell what mood your are in.

6195,b6b4afb96d42,That would be a really cool thing to do at school.
6196,b6b4afb96d42,I think its a good idea asnd I am not going to argue about this suggestion.
6197,b6b4afb96d42,"If you can walk into a classroom and you can tell if a child is happy, sad, confused or even just bored you will be able to know if they are okay."
6198,b6b4afb96d42,If a child is sad you can try and help them and out and see what is going on.
6199,7e03a58cefcb,"
In the passage it says, ""hold on, we can actually calculate emotions."""
6200,7e03a58cefcb,well yes if you actually give it a try.
6201,7e03a58cefcb,It would be seriously so cool to know how someone feels just by looking at a screen when they walk into a classroom.
6202,1391541dd2a3,"I think it would help some students, honestly if you tried this expirement."
6203,a05b03efcdfc,Students wouldn't know what to think if they had this in their classroom.
6204,a05b03efcdfc,None can just walk into a classroom and tell if they are happy or sad.

6206,99b0a0670d41,"They said that they have classified ""six basix emotions- happiness, surpirse, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."
6207,99b0a0670d41,This might help a lot of people out if they do this.
6208,99b0a0670d41,If you can tell a kid is sad you can help the kid.
6209,fd5e32db8f0a,Maybe he or she is having problems at home and they need help but they don't say it.

6211,73efb460bcf9,"It's a good idea, but it's actually a reall good expirement to test it out and see whats going to happen."
6212,73efb460bcf9,"You can alwyas take it out if it doesn't work out, or if it does you can keep doing what you are doing and you'll be able to see kids facial expressions and what they feel when they tell you they don't feel anything."
6213,37579b470e15,Facial Action Coding is just a different way to expirement different things about children.
6214,37579b470e15,"Maybe teachers can bump their classrooms up to funner and more satisfying things, because you will know if a kid is bored in your cass if they have that."
6215,37579b470e15,"It says that ""each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion)."""
6216,37579b470e15,"Let's just try the facial action coding out and see where everything goes, but it seems like it's going to go good."
6217,37579b470e15,I totally agree and I don't argue with this expirement.

6262,753ee802aed3,Have you ever found yourself being bored when doing a project?
6263,753ee802aed3,Have you found it pointless because you get the horrible feeling that you are not learning?
6264,753ee802aed3,It could be because it was designed by your teacher.
6265,753ee802aed3,"Many schools, but not all, require students to complete summer projects in order to get them ready for the upcoming information in those upcoming classes."
6266,753ee802aed3,"Many of those projects are teacher designed which various students tend to dislike because of the singular, required format."
6267,753ee802aed3,"For example, many projects require students to only draw pictures, only write essays, or only build structures related to the certain topic."
6268,753ee802aed3,Many of these students tend to lack the motivation to complete those tasks because they feel uncomfortable doing an action they are inexperienced with.
6269,5807c017331d,"Even though teacher designed summer projects tend to broaden the student's skills by giving them tasks they are somewhat uncomfortable with, it is better for projects to be student designed"
6270,72c501f7aff3,students can strengthen their confident skills
6271,70286e41bd79,learn at their own pace
6272,e1a60b54f65e,have fun while efficiently studying the topic
6273,d7b5a09b7f4d,Student designed projects give students the choice to pick a format they feel comfortable with.
6274,d7b5a09b7f4d,This choice gives the student confidence in their ability to complete the project and strengthens a particular skill in use.
6275,0317e2301905,"For example, Generic_Name, my niece, decided to do drawings for her summer reading project last year."
6276,0317e2301905,"She would say that drawing her own version of the characters from her favorite book,

Diary of the Wimpy Kid , would helped her visualize the story in her own way so she could visualize effectively when reading books without pictures to guide her."
6277,0317e2301905,"When she completed her task, she felt so confident in her work and even said, ""I'm going to do so good on this project."
6278,0317e2301905,"I know my teacher is going to love it."""
6279,0317e2301905,"Because of this, it was noticeable that she obviously felt confident in her outstanding drawings."
6280,0317e2301905,She even became a better drawer from it.
6281,0317e2301905,She turned in her project and got an astounding grade on it.
6282,0317e2301905,"Overall, the experience she had with the project was very rewarding for her because she got a chance to showcase her confident drawings and had the productive opportunity to build on the skill she loved."
6283,6c039eb90e72,Student designed summer projects give students the ability to learn at their own pace while ultimately having fun
6284,a63e6373ab59,"For example, two years ago, my former World History teacher, Mr Generic_Name, had us do a project over the summer about the most important events in world history."
6285,a63e6373ab59,"Fortunately, he gave the opportunity to choose our own format for the project."
6286,a63e6373ab59,"Luckily for my friend Generic_Name, he decided to complete the project in the form of a song, considering he was very musically talented."
6287,a63e6373ab59,Over the summer he would plan when to work on it that best fit his schedule so he wouldn't be stressed to finish the song.
6288,a63e6373ab59,He researched about the effects of World War II and finished his song in no time.
6289,a63e6373ab59,"He stated that it was one of the best projects he had ever completed because for the first time, he felt like he actually learned something while doing an activity that he loved and had fun with."
6290,a63e6373ab59,This clearly shows the effects of giving students a choice in designing their own projects for the best learning experience.
6291,1fcea331e069,Some may argue that teacher designed summer projects give students a chance to broaden and strengthen skills students are uncomfortable with
6292,7e91171f931b,students don't learn that way.
6293,42674f692de8,"For example, this year in my AP Economics class, a peer of mine, Generic_Name, said she didn't understand the point of the summer project, which was to pick a book about economics, she chose the book

Freakonmics , and write an essay on how economic concepts apply to everyday life."
6294,42674f692de8,This is also considering that essay writing is not her specialty.
6295,42674f692de8,She loudly complained about how boring the project was and how it was extremely time consuming.
6296,42674f692de8,She even stated she got nothing out of it.
6297,42674f692de8,"Because she didn't have fun, she didn't learn anything and was furious by this outcome."
6298,42674f692de8,"This undoubtedly shows that teacher designed projects make students feel like they don't learn anything and overall, make them feel bitter about the subject."
6299,7f660d5cc5b6,teacher designed projects don't give the students an efficient way of learning
6300,baeb2b8e39ef,"Some students may find the project uninteresting and because of this, they may not learn the helpful information needed to help them with their classes."
6301,1510f9a18bb0,"if teachers do include this option to student within the projects, it could give students the possibility of having fun and actually learning while they are strengthening skills they feel confident in."
6302,1510f9a18bb0,"All teachers want is for their students to learn in an efficient manner in order to succeed, but that outcome won't be possible if teachers give out projects that don't include student decision making."
6303,1510f9a18bb0,"If teachers want to achieve this outcome, they should give student different options to format their project in order for them to learn in the most efficient way so they can ultimately succeed academically and in the future."

6311,b19f95265fa5,Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system.
6312,b19f95265fa5,"Venus was probably covered largely with Oceans and could have supported varios forms of life just like earth, today Venus still has some features that are sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains and craters, furthermore, recal that Venus can some times be our nearest option for aplanetary visit people like visit at planet Venus they want know about the planet."

6323,beecf575cb56,"However, I think studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."
6324,8c9a2bd1af59,I have couple reasons why I think studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.
6325,b9217e0ea012,"First of all, about 97 percent of a thick atmosphere blankets Venus are carbon dioxide."
6326,ba5b82546709,"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is working on study about the planet, Venus."
6327,ba5b82546709,"If NASA is possible to make spacecraft that could go to land on the surface of Venus, it will be difficult people research on the planet because 97 percent of the atmosphere are carbon dioxide."
6328,ba5b82546709,This condition makes different envionment from Earth.
6329,ba5b82546709,"""A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus""(Paragraph 3)."
6330,6282e1a10d50,"Secondly, the average temperatures of Venus is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit."
6331,cfe17ab70b92,"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit""(Paragraph 3)."
6332,cfe17ab70b92,It is not possible that people stay on Venus on this very high temperature.
6333,d4ecb5ec82d0,"Finally, the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what they experience on Earth."
6334,26fd3c571ddc,"""the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet""(Paragraph 3)."
6335,26fd3c571ddc,"For example, if a person's weight is 70kg, the weight will chage t o 630kg on Venus."
6336,26fd3c571ddc,It is difficult to work on researching on enus.
6337,b995873f9927,"In addition, beyond high pressure and hean, Venusian geography and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful eathquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."

6365,d0a9f4f96177,NASA.
6366,d0a9f4f96177,The United States form of a dominating space academy.
6367,d0a9f4f96177,"The Viking 1, was in fact NASA's spacecraft that was launched in 2001."
6368,d0a9f4f96177,"The spacecraft was set course for the small, red planet that is simillar to Earth."
6369,d0a9f4f96177,The planet is called Mars.
6370,d0a9f4f96177,"Viking 1's ""sister"" Viking 2 was supposed to be landing on Mars, and that's why Viking 1 was sent up in space to begin with."
6371,d0a9f4f96177,"While Viking 1 was snapping photos, its camera picked up a weird face-like structure on the surface of Mars."
6372,d0a9f4f96177,"Some believe its a mysterious face that ""so called aliens"" built."
6373,d0a9f4f96177,I believe that their reasoning is just a bunch of garbage.
6374,5e3df3ed4378,"What I think that is, is just a simple and natural landform made by the underground volcanoes, sandy surface, and rocks that landed there."
6375,0af300ba5e4d,One reason I believe that this is a natural landform is from looking at the photos.
6376,67089f378a3e,"The ""face"" isn't any perticular shape that any man or alien would want."
6377,67089f378a3e,"The landform would be shaped as a circle, square or any other simple shape, and it would not be so ridgid and cracked."
6378,67089f378a3e,"If you were to look at the photo furthest to the left, you would assume that it resembled a face, but If you compair that photo to the one taken twenty-five years later, you would begin to understand that to photo was out-dated and that the camera was not as clear as the one taken later."
6379,67089f378a3e,"In addition, why would an alien make a structure of a human's face."
6380,bcf533f81a33,That part of the theory makes more sense if you take into consideration the angle the camera could have been taken at.
6381,b3e743911ea6,Notice photo two?
6382,b3e743911ea6,Its seems to be taken at an angle where there looks like there is a small mountain range looming over the rest of the area.
6383,b3e743911ea6,This is key evidence explaining how this is just a natural landmark on Mars.
6384,1db7eac42f10,"If you still do not believe me, then this next part will."
6385,1db7eac42f10,"If you think about it, why would NASA keep an amazing discover like this a secret?"
6386,3c138b434c7a,The answer is that they would not.
6387,3c138b434c7a,"If NASA went worldwide with their ""face"" they would make more money than millionaires or even other space academies."
6388,3c138b434c7a,It does not make sense that the academy would keep an alien encounter hidden.
6389,5717b9c6f374,"In conclusion, NASA is either brave or very stupid not to tell people about their ""face"", or people just want to get their word out to make other people critisized, make other people feel stupid, or they just want to feel like they are correct when they are clearly not."
6390,5717b9c6f374,"Therefore; This ""so called face"" is not a face, but it is just a land mark that was naturally constructed by the elements and not alien life-forms."
6391,217cafcd1a5f,I think that the author has a good point her beacuse it teaches the reading that Mars is not the only chicos with this we get to see that ther is other chicos that we can pick if one day we have to leave plant earth.
6392,217cafcd1a5f,Venus is a instreting plant because its sometimes cloeser to us then mars and it can help understand how to take care of earth.
6393,217cafcd1a5f,With this we get to see what we can change and what.
6394,217cafcd1a5f,We dont need to change about our plant Earth and what we do need to chance.
6395,217cafcd1a5f,Earth is a good plant but Venus is a plant that we dont fully understand as most plants Venus is a plant that is new to the human kind.
6396,8403adc5b634,What Venus have that we dont which is good that the envioment can cush a submarin and the conditions.
6397,8403adc5b634,That it might not let a human leave in Venus is dangerous.
6398,8403adc5b634,But can be really helpful like if its amosphere is so strange can take some samples and can use it to help the earth be more protective.
6399,8403adc5b634,It can help us understand why its like and if one day and see if some one can live up there.
6400,8403adc5b634,Vensu us the hottest sureface temperture in our whole solors system which is perrt col if you ask me its hooter then the summer on the earth because its cloers to the sun.
6401,2ac008ff1309,`I think that us as human need to study Venus close and see waht it really is can see if it can help us understand our plant more and more.
6402,793bdde60307,We need to watch it closly to send people up there and see if tis right for humans.
6403,793bdde60307,but yeah i think that Venus is a cool plant to study more cloly because its reaslly insterting to see how a differtn platn works everyday.
6404,793bdde60307,We need to study it more so we cansee why its called the Evening Stare why its cloer to the sun why we need to talk about more to peepole so they may see how insterting is to study a plant like Venus.
6405,dc923591fd09,"Being a seagoing cowboy was much more than adventure, for me."
6406,a02f0bf9fce1,I love being able to go out on the sea and have fun will helpping people with there problems make me super happy and I wouldn't have this job if my friend didn't tell me about it.
6407,a02f0bf9fce1,"For example (the world war11) I got to go to many places like China, Europe, and Italy."
6408,a02f0bf9fce1,"I was happy to help all this people with there problems and when we got to go on a ship, we had the opportunity to take turns to watch over the animals at night to feed them and to make sure that nothing bad is happening like fighting our the bottom of the ship is being filled up with water."
6409,a02f0bf9fce1,So I signed up to watch them and so I got the job.
6410,a02f0bf9fce1,I had to stay up super late to watch them and to I went to tell the captin that every thing was okay and so on my way I slipped on some water and I fell.
6411,a02f0bf9fce1,"I had almost fell overboared but I didn't, thanks to a peice of meatel on the side of the boat and i was happy that I didnt die."
6412,a02f0bf9fce1,"I am thankful that I am still alive after breaking my ribs, and slidding down a latter."
6413,a02f0bf9fce1,I soon recovered and was back to the job and so we took all the animals back to were they were.
6414,a02f0bf9fce1,So we made a game place were they were.
6415,a02f0bf9fce1,"We played a whole bunch of games and we did are ruiten, until we had another jod were we had to go get animals and watch over them."
6416,a02f0bf9fce1,I am thankful to be able to do this job with people who care about me and support me well this job.
6417,a02f0bf9fce1,I wonder what are next job will be?
6418,a02f0bf9fce1,Will I break another bone in my body?
6419,a02f0bf9fce1,Can I survie another animal watch?
6420,a02f0bf9fce1,Will I survie breaking another bone in my body?
6421,a02f0bf9fce1,I don't know if i can survie another bone in my boby that can be broken?
6422,a02f0bf9fce1,"After about a month we get a call to go get some animals and so we went to go get them and I have to say it was a long ride to go to Teaxs and it was close to were my uncle lived and so we got there and there was a huge sand storm and so we had to go get alll the horses, and take them to the sea and then I relized that my uncle had this one horse and it did not like me at all."
6423,a02f0bf9fce1,As we were getting the horses around I seen that horse.
6424,a02f0bf9fce1,"The captin asked me if I wanted to watch the animals that week and I said "", Yes I will'."
6425,a02f0bf9fce1,So I was up all night watching all the horses and so I had to feed them.
6426,a02f0bf9fce1,I was feed the one horse that hated me the most and it kicked me right in the neck as I was feeding him.
6427,a02f0bf9fce1,"I was out for a really long time and my best friend came down there and found me on the floor ""sleeping""."

6430,c1000d329ad1,this quote is telling us that the eveing star is really bright and its the most beautyfull star of all stars in the sky.

6433,c1000d329ad1,"venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar sysrem, even though mercury is closer to our sun."
6434,c1000d329ad1,The national aeronautice and space administration NASA has one particularry compelling idea for sending humans to study venus.
6435,c1000d329ad1,NASA possible solution to the hodtile conditions on the surface of venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.
6436,c1000d329ad1,imagine a blimp like vehile hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusain landscape.
6437,c1000d329ad1,At 30 plus miles above the surface temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees fahrenheit but the air pressure would be close to that sea level on earth.
6438,c1000d329ad1,Solar power would be plentiful and radition would not exceed earth levels not easy condition but survivable.
6439,0b5b8f4d166f,in conclution this story is all about eart and the venus .
6440,b597b8c17913,The technology that they are starting to use to see people different emotion can help lots of people out when they think they don't have emotions.
6441,b597b8c17913,The software would be great for people when what to know the percents of there emotion and what they show every day.
6442,03fe06734eab,Computers show be allowed to read the emotions of the student in from of them so that maybe the computer can help.
6443,7d61cf32bdbc,An example of why they should be allowed is because the computer just doesnt scan just a few it scans all 44 muscles in your face.
6444,7d61cf32bdbc,It allows the computer to maybe bring something up to you to realise that maybe this is something that i need to look into for maybe fun or help.
6445,cb6573b991df,Its helps the students outs when they are trying to figure out what they can do to help with each emotion you have.
6446,8763f501ae9a,Another reason why computer show be allowed to scan emotions is because the software can identify mix emotion.
6447,24c032875d34,"Its said by Dr. Huang,"" The facial expression for each emotion is universal even though individual often show vary degree of expression."""
6448,24c032875d34,"The software uses video imagery, the emtion-recognition software track there facial movement in a real face or a painted face."
6449,1ba3641767e8,Therefore computer should be used to scan students emotions just so maybe is its really bad the school can do something for that student and get them the help they need.
6450,1ba3641767e8,This would be alot helpful if computer could help or tell the school whats students emotions actaul are and what the percents is.
6451,1e269a8844a0,"I do agree that student's should at least do one activity like help work on the year book's, sports,student council, etc."
6452,600076807ce3,If i had to pick one activity it would be student council because i can help people like if their going through tough times.
6453,b4077b2c71d1,"Say if they have trouble in school, try to help them with there grade's, or maybe the lost a love one."
6454,b4077b2c71d1,I would convince other to support me because i listen to people about what wrong or if there going thought something.
6455,b4077b2c71d1,I care about people feelings and i won't say anything in till there done.
6456,b4077b2c71d1,"Why do i want to do this is because say if your mom,dad,granddad, or grandma die in a car crush wouldn you be upset because that's your family member or maybe they die of the corona would you be upset you would want a councilor, brother, or sister."
6457,b4077b2c71d1,What i'm trying to say is that people need a council to help them out.
6458,b4077b2c71d1,Ok say that a truck smash your house wouldn't you be in shock in that case you would need a council right.
6459,b4077b2c71d1,"What i trying to say is that i want people to support me to do what i want to do, like say i want to help people out through family problem or like a love one die of cancer, heart attack, car crush, etc."
6460,b4077b2c71d1,I would be there to help them through there problem.
6461,b4077b2c71d1,it would be my honor to help people out.
6462,8681f92b2445,Your principal has decided that all student's must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.
6463,8681f92b2445,I would do anything to help out people in need for what ever they want me to here i will be there for there need or whats i will be there in spirit.

6465,d80c01b68a34,could visit alot of cool places.
6466,21232c6dc9bc,you could go anywhere you wanted to.
6467,f36a30a149dd,Its also good if you like to help people.
6468,f36a30a149dd,If you love helping people then you should participate in this program.
6469,e90f64330240,another thing thats good about this program is that you can do it with a friend.
6470,e90f64330240,If you like to hangout with your friend alot then you should participate in this program.
6471,6fe5f8cb857f,Another thing great about the Seagoing cowboys is that if you like helping animals you should do it.
6472,069bc188ec75,You get to take care of and look after all the animals on the boat.
6473,069bc188ec75,feeding and looking after animals is a great to do with a friend.
6474,069bc188ec75,even if you dont like animals.
6475,7a19201eac60,The seagoing cowboys program is an unbelivible opportunity for somebody to go across the ocean and see places people dont get to see everyday.
6476,16ef57c275f3,"I had been to europe,china greece and have even crossed the ocean 16 times!"
6477,16ef57c275f3,"The favorite place ive been to was venice,Italy,a city with streets of water."
6478,16ef57c275f3,Theres also so many places you can go.
6479,16ef57c275f3,"Ive been to China,Greece,Europe,Venice,italy and even crete."
6480,16ef57c275f3,There I toured an excavated castle.
6481,16ef57c275f3,This program is the perfect opportunity to visit any place you want to.
6482,c7c92a53c89b,There are some flaws to this program.
6483,c7c92a53c89b,Its very dangerous.
6484,ffcd396b7344,I almost slid off the boat in the middle of the night.
6485,ffcd396b7344,your also going to be in the ocean for hours until you reach your destination.
6486,b04c6754ae52,But all in the end its a really good program.
6487,a10f88fac282,I am for the value of this technollogy to read students emotional expressions.
6488,22edd8b80157,"To start off with I think this would be a. good idea because it says in the article ""for instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling by just simply by the look on there face."""
6489,22edd8b80157,This proves you can probably tell how one of your friends are feeling by just a expression on there face but my point is this that the technollogy can tell what emotions youtr friend is actually feeling
6490,aa35293474a5,This would be helpful because sometimes you ask a friend what is wrong and they just say nothing but you know something is wrong by the way they are acting and this technollogy will help with that because and can tell what emotions they re actuallyu feeling
6491,4f767382c86c,"In addition, this technoollogy would also be a positive because you can know when anyone is happy,sad or frustrated"
6492,d08c346a1376,"For example it says in the article ""imagine a computer that knows when your happy or sad."
6493,d08c346a1376,"For exampe, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow, but if yyou frown, the next ad will be different.''"
6494,d08c346a1376,This shows that you can tell how someone is feeling just based on if they smile or frown.
6495,3faa93ab4fd9,Personally I am against this because I would love to know what everyone is feeling if they asre my frien oir not and know the real reason why they are acting the way they are no matter if they are sad or happy.
6496,ea2257b93733,"In conclusion, I am for this technollogy to read students emotinoal feelings because i would like to know how everyone is feeling and acting the way they are."
6497,ea2257b93733,"For instance, what if it is a friendand no matter how close you are they will not t ell you if they are upset or happy and if you had this technollogy you could tell what they are feeling because they could lie and say they are not feeling anything which then this technollogy could then help with that."

6542,26e024cd7249,There are many reasons why people would think that the face was created by aliens.
6543,26e024cd7249,There are also many reasons why people would think it is a natural landform.
6544,26e024cd7249,"Either way, do we really know what it is?"
6545,c6309d7f04b2,The face is a very mysterious thing
6546,599fd5456e4e,It's not every day you see something resemble a face on a planet.
6547,599fd5456e4e,There are many people out there that believe it is just a natural landform.
6548,599fd5456e4e,People think that because there are many landforms on Earth that resemble a face so why think that aliens did it just because it is on another planet.
6549,599fd5456e4e,Also they might not belive in aliens.
6550,780b4c380147,There are also people who think aliens created it.
6551,780b4c380147,They think this because it really isn't an everyday think to see a landform that resembles a face.
6552,f78d923bc44e,So they start to think what could have created that.
6553,f78d923bc44e,Since it is on Mars they instantly think aliens.
6554,f78d923bc44e,They think aliens because they can't think of what else could cause that and they think aliens can do crazy things like shape the land.
6555,f78d923bc44e,Also people read things from newspaper articles that talk about it and watch movies about aliens and see them do crazy things like shape the land and other crazy things.
6556,9f87cd5fb439,People who think the face is just a natural landform probably think the people that believe aliens made it are crazy.
6557,ecde530a221c,"They might think they are crazy because there is no proof that aliens exist, so why think that something that might not exist create something like a face in a planet."
6558,ecde530a221c,It makes more sense that it is a natural landform that just so happens to resemble a face.
6559,ecde530a221c,Not many scientists believed it was an alien artifact so many people would think that is a natural landform because scientists don't believe it is something aliens created.
6560,5971a914d41e,"On April 5, 1998 Michael Malin and his ""Mars Orbiter Camera"" took a picture of the face."
6561,5971a914d41e,The picture was ten times sharper than the original and it proved that it was just a natural landform.
6562,7fb40a9506b1,People who believed aliens created it were unsatisfied because the way Mars faced in 98' it was winter time.
6563,7fb40a9506b1,So it was very cloudy.
6564,e9aa24b2441c,"But on April 8, 2001 he set out for another picture."
6565,e9aa24b2441c,They took an extrodinary picture.
6566,e9aa24b2441c,Again it proved it was just a landform.
6567,40cedec69302,So therefore the people who thought it was just a landform were correct.
6568,f1eddeaabeec,people had many reasons to believe what they believed.
6569,f1eddeaabeec,Michael Malin had to find out the answer and find out what exaclty made it.
6570,f1eddeaabeec,That's exaclty what he did.
6571,f1eddeaabeec,He found out it was just a landform that resembled a face.
6572,6821ef428800,But does that mean that the people who believe aliens created it believe that it is just a landorm because of a picture?
6573,6821ef428800,Maybe not but almost everyone believes/knows it is a landform because of the picture and observations.

6581,986979e6b4f2,High schoolers are very busy people who rather not spend a portion of their summer completing school work.
6582,986979e6b4f2,"With the help of their teachers, having the teacher-designed summer assignment, students will have the motivation to work and complete what is being asked of them."
6583,986979e6b4f2,"Going into a new school year, students could never imagine what may occur or what teacher they may get."
6584,986979e6b4f2,"It could be an easier course but with a difficult teacher, or a challenging course with a relaxed teacher."
6585,986979e6b4f2,"Having these teacher-designed assignments, will provide knowledge to the students that they may need for the upcoming class."
6586,986979e6b4f2,It will give them a peek as to what they may expect while enrolled.
6587,986979e6b4f2,"This is important because most students base their course selections off of what their friends are taking, rather than what they are more interested in."
6588,986979e6b4f2,"These students may have no idea what the course is about, so it's beneficial to have the teachers create the necessary work."
6589,986979e6b4f2,"Saying this, with the expectations held by teachers, it's only fair for students to be prepared."
6590,986979e6b4f2,"Assigning this type of work, will help take a leading hand in the successes waiting for these curios students."
6591,40df038402c6,"With the idea of no school, beaches, and long nights, students won't be focusing on work."
6592,40df038402c6,Students then tend to lack academically because their brain hasn't been tested for quite some time.
6593,40df038402c6,"Brain activity never stops, even when sleeping, but it does forget how to preform in certain circumstances."
6594,40df038402c6,"Luckily, teachers understand that this happens because even teachers go through this mindset."
6595,40df038402c6,"They don't give these assignment because they feel like it, but because they know who teenagers are."
6596,40df038402c6,"If students begin to expect no work during breaks, this will continue to occur"
6597,fde6032ce3cf,"Teacher-designed summer assignments will continue to test the ability within each student, while keeping their brains on track"
6598,0efb90c37081,"In comparison, students will be given the same amount of work when assigned these projects."
6599,0efb90c37081,"No one student will have to do more than the other, unless given a choice"
6600,ed1cc89d0c0c,Student-designed projects may bring conflict to some who feel that they're doing more than another.
6601,ed1cc89d0c0c,This will only cause more stress on teachers and students who rather spend their time worrying about their own work.
6602,ed1cc89d0c0c,Students who may have had an older sibling in the same class tell them what to expect and then them receiving something completely different angers students.
6603,ed1cc89d0c0c,"Students stick to the idea that everyone should get what others get, nothing different."
6604,ed1cc89d0c0c,"If they receive something opposing their original belief, they will bring it to the teacher's attention almost immediately."
6605,ed1cc89d0c0c,The importance of teacher-designed projects is to inform the student not cause arguments.
6606,ed1cc89d0c0c,"In addition, it will also limit the amount of work teachers have to put in."
6607,ed1cc89d0c0c,Teachers can then focus on what the main idea of the project is and assess each student based off of that.
6608,73843633f9cc,"Summer assignments should not be seen as a waste of time, but something that helps the individual continue to educate, prepare, and reflect on their own learning."
6609,73843633f9cc,"As a teenager in high school, the addition resources assigned are drastically helpful."
6610,73843633f9cc,"They limit worry, stress, and over all forgetfulness."
6611,73843633f9cc,This is all given when the project is teacher-designed because it ensures that what is being done is beneficial for the upcoming year.
6612,73843633f9cc,Teachers keep in mind that it's not what one does with the work provided but what they make of it.
6613,73843633f9cc,"The projects teachers create, test the capabilities of the individual and their ability to apply this knowledge."
6614,73843633f9cc,All in which is important for a successful student.
6615,9736c8de8e00,"As students grow older, they will be assigned an appropriate amount of responsibilities, such as schoolwork and projects; even some that are meant to be completed by the first day of school."
6616,9736c8de8e00,"Summer project can be intimidating to some students, however, summer projects are only meant to benefit the students."
6617,9736c8de8e00,"The benefits of summer projects include: the continuation of study and time management skills, as well as reading and writing."
6618,9736c8de8e00,There is a simple solution that could be put in effect by the school officials and administration; allowing students to design their own projects based off a topic that peaks their interest.
6619,9736c8de8e00,Allowing students to design their own projects will significantly increase the interest level and positive feedback that will be the deciding factor in whether or not the project is assigned the next year.
6620,9736c8de8e00,"The interest level and feedback received will be based off of the following: if students are given the opportunity to conduct research that they find intriguing, not what their teacher finds intriguing; their final project will be significantly better than if the project was teacher-designed."
6621,3c57ee2d6ec6,Summer projects should be student-designed
6622,4f227462b539,allow students to focus on a topic that they are passionate about
6623,c15754df3a8f,allow students to continue learning important skills
6624,9901c5fccbc4,allow students to share a topic that they find interesting.
6625,79a231f380cb,"Discovering passions may be difficult at a young age, however, if students are given the opportunity to focus on a topic that they find passion in, it will create a well-done project."
6626,e88fc5a56c44,"Passions could include: athletics, academics, or an extra curricular; such as music, band, or the arts."
6627,e88fc5a56c44,A student-designed project will let students study a topic that they are interested in.
6628,e88fc5a56c44,"If students are interested in what they are studying or researching, then there is a increased chance of students truly enjoying the project."
6629,e88fc5a56c44,"As mentioned about, a student-designed project will allow for a quality project."
6630,e88fc5a56c44,"The more say students have regarding their schoolwork, the better the outcome of that work."
6631,e88fc5a56c44,"Personally, when given the chance to chose the topic or project guideline, there is a much better result than when given a strict outline."
6632,e88fc5a56c44,"Typically, summer projects appear to be a burden for some students, however, students will not see a project about their passions as a concern."
6633,a6a5e5f417e7,"Study skills, such as spacing out workdays and time management, are skills that students will continue to use as they further their education."
6634,a6a5e5f417e7,"Scheduling workdays is a simple way to reduce stress, and a way for students to not feel overwhelmed."
6635,a6a5e5f417e7,Time management goes along with spacing out workdays because it will prevent students from cramming in the project the night before it is due.
6636,a6a5e5f417e7,"If students leave the project until the last minute, the result will not be pleasing and it would be a waste of an opportunity for students to find one of their true passions."
6637,a6a5e5f417e7,Students will also be given the opportunity to learn the proper way to research their topic.
6638,a6a5e5f417e7,This is yet another skill that students will use as they continue their education.
6639,a6a5e5f417e7,Learning how to start researching and then learning what can be cut out is a challenging process that students can learn through the process of trial and error.
6640,a6a5e5f417e7,"Students will be able to take the research from various reliable resources, and develop their project, while learning an additional skill: project design."
6641,a6a5e5f417e7,Designing a project so it is appealing to most and finding what is most convenient for you is important because it will allow future projects to be completed in an effective and efficient manner.
6642,7211218baca2,"allow students to get to know each other, work on public speaking and presentation skills, and will show students topics of interest."
6643,548b37b5f1d3,Projects that are controlled by the student will allow icebreaker activities to run smoothly.
6644,548b37b5f1d3,"Icebreaker activities are typically included in the first day of school, and they allow students to get to know each other and their teacher."
6645,548b37b5f1d3,"If every student came prepared to share their presentation, they they would not only learn something about their fellow classmates, but they would also get the chance to work on their public speaking and presentation skills."
6646,548b37b5f1d3,"Public speaking may be one of the most relevant and commonly used skills as you enter higher education and the workforce, as it is something that is hard to avoid."
6647,548b37b5f1d3,"The more it is practiced, the more comfortable people, in this case, student will get with it."
6648,548b37b5f1d3,Students can also use this project as a starting to point to see where they might what to take their future.
6649,548b37b5f1d3,"Deciding classes for the next school year, or even thinking about a college major can be difficult and intimidating."
6650,548b37b5f1d3,"However, if students know their passions and interests, then the process will seem significantly less worrisome."
6651,548b37b5f1d3,"A way to reduce the stress on making decision such as classes or college, is to let students discover their interests through student-designed projects."
6652,d315371dbf48,"If summer projects are fully designed by students, then students will be able to focus on their passions, improve their study skills, and share a topic that they find interesting."
6653,d315371dbf48,"Revealing the topics that students find passion in will lead to a quality projects, a head start in determining courses and majors, and will serve as a way to learn necessary skills for college and the workforce."
6654,d315371dbf48,"The more opportunities students are given to decide what they want to study or complete a project about will allow students to find those passions, such as sports, a specific class, or a certain type of art or drama."
6655,d315371dbf48,"Student-designed project will also let students learn the skills that are most useful for them, for instance: time management or public speaking."
6656,d315371dbf48,"Most importantly, students will be able to discover who they truly are through a project that they design."
6657,a4f77a0107b5,People say not everyone can do what some people can do.
6658,a4f77a0107b5,A person can be good at something while someone else is terrible at it.
6659,19617f23c0dc,I disagree with this decision because you go to school to learn about what you need to know for the future.
6660,19617f23c0dc,"You don't go to school to learn about sports, or learn how to make yearbooks."
6661,19617f23c0dc,You don't go to school to get pushed by someone about something you don't want to do.
6662,19617f23c0dc,You should be able to have your own choice.
6663,b32c74bf2b5b,"For instance, I play basketball for my school."
6664,b32c74bf2b5b,I had my own choice of if I wanted to tryout for basketball or not.
6665,4c43f7051809,Not everyone likes playing basketball like me.
6666,4c43f7051809,I like basketball because when im on or off the court it makes me think about the game not about life or whats happening on the bleachers.
6667,4c43f7051809,I try my best at practice so I can maybe start in a game.
6668,4c43f7051809,You got to work hard for something you want.
6669,ff8865b76a53,Another example is when I get older I want to be a cosmataligist.
6670,fffbe5640149,Some people may want to be one also.
6671,fffbe5640149,Others might think the opposite.
6672,fffbe5640149,"When I was a kid I use to play with doll's hair and watch YouTube videos on how to die hair, cut hair, and also brush hair the right way."
6673,bbb76d490527,I was trying to explain that not everyone is the same.
6674,bbb76d490527,You might have the same talent as someone or you may not and thats okay if not.
6675,bbb76d490527,You might want to be the same thing as someone when you get older but someone may want to be the opposite.
6676,f92192b2fdfb,How i feel about this article talking about having a piece of technology that could show and tell you what people are feeling is pretty crazy.
6677,123cfa2f93b1,Ok with starting this off i would say that i am against this
6678,2ff97209e420,because yeah it would be cool to see peoples emotions and see how people are feeling
6679,56d9233b802d,but i think it is bad because teachers for example would use it whenever and espically when a student is mad or acting strange or if the teacher and student got in an argument.
6680,5fa6bbac41b2,The teacher would use it to see how they where feeling and with one other thing if a student is texting under his lap or something is smiling or showing some type of motion a teacher could have the machine read what they are feeling about during that time to even hundred percent know kids where on there phones that could be a good thing for teachers but bad for students and that would make students even more mad or anything towards school or teachers
6681,e3889392c19c,i think something to let you see emotion would be bad to have in school because you don't need to no how people are feeling its not your buisness to know.
6682,3711b3fd11f7,And to sum this all up in my conclusion to the essay of the article is that it would be cool to see something like that but not in school and they should have it set up in places where people could go in public.
6683,3711b3fd11f7,And try not in schools or places that need it like hospitals or places for crazy people just not school the end.
6684,74219131ec8f,The reson you should join this organization
6685,330cf056998c,it has so many opportunitys that open up for you and your family.
6686,393910cf22ee,For example you would get to meet new people everyday you would get to see new things all the time.
6687,fe90eaf73747,Especially if you don't like working long hours at work
6688,d831663e61be,because if you are Seagoing Cowboy you only have to work a couple hours a day.
6689,fb596d3dcb86,You should especially join if you like to see ancient artifacts such as an old castle is Crete and even the Panama Canal.
6690,1ce7f4171f6f,The down sides of being a Seagoing Cowboy is that you will have to travel far from home and stay away from your family for long periods of time and you wouldn't get to see them much.
6691,1ab316db5083,Those are some resons that you should join the organization because like I said it would be such an opportunity for you and your family.
6692,1ab316db5083,"Make sure you join if you would like to see cool things, meet unique people, and just have fun, but if you don't like staying away from home you shouldn't join because you will have to stay for long periods of time."
6693,1ab316db5083,There are also some reasons that you would not want to join.
6694,1ab316db5083,Just remember all of these things could change your life for eve
6695,e10c68ef9f8f,I am all for this new technology to read peoples emotions
6696,dfb0070414d0,If we could read their emotions it would be easier to help people to get better if they are in a bad place in life.
6697,a4c16face773,It would help so many people that are depressed and need help but afrad ask for it
6698,0365a7a1d374,when people get help with their emotions they become more stable then they were before.
6699,9bd3eb76ca6b,Im all for the values of using this new emotion technology because you tell if people are faking a smile.
6700,9bd3eb76ca6b,You can tell because when you fake it you dont use the same muscles as when you really smile.
6701,9bd3eb76ca6b,When you fake smile the muscles you use are zygomatic major that make your mouth stretche sideways and the risori.
6702,9bd3eb76ca6b,But when you really smile you use the muscles called zygomatic major that begin at your cheek bones and life the corners of your mouth.
6703,9bd3eb76ca6b,The other muscle you use is called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus which makes crow's-feet around your eyes.
6704,681e1279043f,This is way i think we should use this technology in the futer.
6705,681e1279043f,It could help with so many things.
6706,681e1279043f,People could get the help they need.
6707,681e1279043f,Life would just be so much better if we all could understand each other.
6708,681e1279043f,This will be one of the best things you can do for someone needs and wants help to make their life and friends and familys lifes better.
6709,df85708f1617,The author claims that no matter the dangers that venus should still be explored.
6710,df85708f1617,i agree
6711,89ec34b7e602,becuse it is a neighoring planet as well as earths twin and could have been inhabitable a very llong time ago meaning lifeforms could have been living their or still live on venus.
6712,301787e295ad,venus is high radiated and very hot their atmospheric pressure is high.
6713,301787e295ad,The thought of any person wanting to go their is dispicable because of such harsh conditions.
6714,d8a83924ad7d,But the author does think that venus should be explored dispite the conditions
6715,aacaacae27ce,doing so will take alot of tech we dont have yet
6716,55870a027137,but mechanical mechines can be used be cause they are not electrical like computers or smartphones
6717,b28a6a77fee6,NASA feels that the best way to explore venus is to hover over it but in order to actually explore said planet you must get close and collect samples thhis will provide evidence for what was missed in the earlier times we tried to explore venus
6718,429d4c695e01,Along with it being our neighboring planet is has alot of similarities such as size and shape
6719,bcb62adda343,But also differences such as the planet being almost 800 degrees fahrenheit.
6720,bcb62adda343,The presure could be so strong it can crush submarines that are able to go to the deepest parts of the ocean could be liquefyed
6721,2a0431d368be,venus a very intresting planet to explore so maybe one day we will be able to visit tis place and search for samples and look for unkown elements.
6722,e8eba4eae861,It is sutable to assume that NASA will still try to explore venus.
6723,e8eba4eae861,And figure if their is a way to explore it and venture to et samples and find eelements and reduce the dangers in venus.
6724,b19122f905d3,The Facial Action coding system enable computers to identify humans emotions
6725,2d9b40821a9e,"Dr. Huang relies the work of psychologists such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS, Eckman has classified about six basic emotions which are happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and even sadness after that he even then associated each with characteristic movements of the facial muscles in which for example, are frontalis pars laterlis muscle (above your eyes) in the raises of are eyebrows when we are surprised; are orbicularis oris (around are mouth) tighten are lips to show anger."
6726,4fb6907b996c,"The Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to are face, while in the computer it shows it in how much it can do"
6727,b6e3a4bcf641,"In the computer imagine know when we are happy or even sad for example, if we smile when a Wed ad appears on are screen, a similar ad might follow."
6728,b6e3a4bcf641,"But if we frown, the next ad will be different."
6729,b6e3a4bcf641,"When we are looking in the mirror:

* raise your lips at the corner of your mouth,

* when you squint your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the corner of your eyes,

* when you hold it, rise the outer pars of your cheek up, toward your eyes,

In fact, these are instructionws for a face that looks happy."
6730,b6e3a4bcf641,"In a real smile, the zygomatic major (muscles that begin at yourt cheek bones) lifts the corner of you mouth."
6731,b6e3a4bcf641,(that's out instruction #1.)
6732,b6e3a4bcf641,"Meanwhile, muscles called orbicularis oculi pars palpabraeus make crow's-feet around your eyes."
6733,b6e3a4bcf641,"But in a false smile, the mouth is stretched sidways using the zygomstic major and a different muscle, the risorius."
6734,6f7f1d0bddb1,"Theoty of Emotion, Moving are facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them"
6735,ea2e9a0a52f9,"in what you are feeling that day and how you felt last night, you show emotion at school, work, even at your own house."
6736,ea2e9a0a52f9,"Emotion are express in how your day was, your emotions is like a tv show in how but act you fell what they feel if they are happy, mad, sad, or even scard."
6737,0a94635ba557,"Technology all around us is evolving, we're now to the point where we can tell how exactly Mona Lisa was feeling when her famous picture was painted."
6738,0a94635ba557,"Due to new technology such as, the Facial Action Coding System, professionals can tell exactly how someone is feeling in a picture, or even in class during a lesson."
6739,424be938a101,This new application will have a massive impact on how teachers educate kids.
6740,1c08f477efd8,This will help out teachers with how to teach a lesson
6741,bd9da2daa8a5,improve how engaged kids will be in class.
6742,957abe7311c7,"First, classroom computers could use this program to recongnize when a student is confused or bored."
6743,22400585ff71,The computer would then modify the lesson so the student will hopefully become interested again.
6744,22400585ff71,This program could really get kids to learn and become interested about what is being taught.
6745,22400585ff71,This would ultimately lead to higher passing rates and better futures for kids.
6746,e0bb0eaed1a9,"Secondly, this technology can make video games or video surgery alot more expressive."
6747,cf5941af289f,Some faces in videos are really bland and boring.
6748,cf5941af289f,If the faces were better detailed and more expressive the viewer will be interested and will pay more attention.
6749,cf5941af289f,"Expressions on animated faces are really important, these features draw the viewers attention and will interest them."
6750,7abc764c1f2e,"All in all, this new technology is very valuable in a classroom."
6751,7abc764c1f2e,It would durrastically change how kids learn and would make them way more interested than they currently are.
6752,7abc764c1f2e,"Most kids do not learn the same, this technology could change that so each student can learn the way that best helps them."
6753,7abc764c1f2e,This application will help out teachers tremendously and could really improve passing rates!

6771,f1d994b60ac5,Pollution is the second largest source of America's emissions just behind power plants.
6772,f1d994b60ac5,Many sociologist have seen these statistics and have also noticed that American transportation usuage has slowly been declining since its peak in 2005.
6773,f1d994b60ac5,"People are slowly but surely helping the cause in their own ways, whether its by delaying getting there license, limit there driving, or even car-pooling with friends."
6774,f1d994b60ac5,"Limiting car and vehicle usage can reduce pollution, nearly eliminate accidents, and makes the road a safer place to be."
6775,b912f26c6c56,Most people you know probably participate in some form of an extracurricular activity.
6776,b912f26c6c56,"Whether it be sports, a school club, theatre, or something else, almost all of us have participated in an extracurricular at some point in our lives."
6777,b912f26c6c56,"Extracurricular activities have many benefits, such as an opportunity to do something you enjoy, which will make you happier and help you relieve stress, and an opportunity to meet new people who share your interests."
6778,b912f26c6c56,"However, some people may argue that extracurricular activities take away time that they don't have, but there's a solution for that."
6779,ba114284d972,I agree with the principle's decision to have everyone participate in an extracurricular activity because there are many benefits that come from participating in them.
6780,acef3a6cd4e0,Extracurricular activities are a great way to do something you enjoy.
6781,f5811496b3c2,There are many different things to do which means that there is something for everyone.
6782,f5811496b3c2,Having the opportunity to be participating in something you enjoy will make you happier.
6783,f5811496b3c2,"It has been proven that when you're happier, you have lower stress levels."
6784,f5811496b3c2,"When asked, 9 out of 10 students said that they felt stressed by school often."
6785,f5811496b3c2,An extracurricular activity is a great way to relieve some of that stress.
6786,f5811496b3c2,"By participating in something you enjoy and something you chose to do, you'll be able to improve your skills, which can give you a sense of accomplishment and happiness."
6787,f5811496b3c2,These are just some of the benefits of an extracurricular activity.
6788,54ab425f034a,Extracurricular activities are also a great way to meet new people.
6789,194427ddcb23,"There are people that come from all different backgrounds, that you may not have classes with at school, that may be in different grades, or that you may have never known without participating in an extracurricular activity."
6790,194427ddcb23,These new people will share the same interests as you which is a great way to be able to do things together and it gives you an opportunity to be able to learn from each other.
6791,194427ddcb23,"By being in an extracurricular activity where you get to meet these new people, you'll have an opportunity to hang out with them on a regular basis when you may not have been able to do that any other time."
6792,194427ddcb23,These are just some of the other many benefits that an extracurricular activity can bring.
6793,f01cd71bfd6f,There are some people who may argue against everyone having to participate in an extracurricular activity.
6794,f01cd71bfd6f,They may say that they don't have the time to participate and if they do then they won't get their school work done.
6795,57676098bc2f,"However, other people who participate in extracurricular activities get their work done on time which means that there are ways to do so."
6796,fd846b606185,You also won't have that activity every single day which means that it won't inflict on your everyday life.
6797,fd846b606185,"If you're worried about not having time to get work done, you can focus really hard during your study hall period to get more work done, you can get up earlier in the mornings to get extra work done, and you can even do work on your way to or from the activity, or to and from school in the mornings and afternoons."
6798,a302d8c9c7c3,You may also argue that there are no extracurricular activities that are offered that you want to participate in.
6799,8214b4c17654,"However, there is such a wide variety of things to do at most schools that there is something everyone can enjoy."
6800,6cdb586f53a5,"However if there isn't something you would want to participate in, most schools will help you create a new club that you can recruit people for and run with a teachers help."
6801,6cdb586f53a5,"Even if people want to argue against this new rule, there are solutions to their complaints"
6802,34aecb0c2100,"Overall, there are many benefits to participating in extracurricular activities."
6803,34aecb0c2100,"You get to do something you enjoy, you get to meet new people, you'll be happier, and although people may find ways to argue against the new requirements, the good outweighs the bad."
6804,34aecb0c2100,There are plenty of options at most schools so that everyone can find something that they enjoy.
6805,34aecb0c2100,"There are plenty of different sports, there are debate clubs, the student council, yearbook committee, the school newspaper, theatre, and clubs for almost any interest someone may have."
6806,34aecb0c2100,"In conclusion, I agree fully with the principal's new decision and I believe that everyone should participate in some type of extracurricular as well."
6807,2a4741306fcf,"To maintain a healthy, active mind, many students are assigned an educational, summer-long project."
6808,2a4741306fcf,These assignments vary from science experiments to maintaining a reading log; anything that would keep kids busy on their summer-long vacation.
6809,2a4741306fcf,"However, there is the question of if these summer assignments should be created by teachers or by the students themselves."
6810,4de905cb0850,"To create the optimal educational experience, summer projects should be self-administered"
6811,ed4c1aea5a43,so that they are individualized for every student
6812,b5ea92ecc61e,"so they are easy to manage,"
6813,485b2a511093,and so students can learn how to be self-sufficient.
6814,2a622edb810c,Providing students with the opportunity to take control of their own summer project makes the assignment more individualized.
6815,dc507774dc97,Compare the idea of assigning a summer project to the scenario of a student choosing their classes; they are much more likely be perform well in a subject of their interest than in a random class enforced upon them.
6816,dc507774dc97,"Relating this back to summer projects, students tend to better commit to a project that aligns with their interests."
6817,dc507774dc97,"Also, Students are more motivated when they have control over their decisions."
6818,dc507774dc97,"When people take a personal initiative towards what they do, they carry more pride and are more successful in their work."
6819,dc507774dc97,Personalization of summer projects produce more meaningful experiences that serve as a solid foundation for education.
6820,ded3cfcb0c0f,"As students are away from school for a long three months, there is no other person better than the students themselves to manage a personal project."
6821,ded3cfcb0c0f,"Teacher are not aware of the responsibilities or vacation plans of their students, so the expectations they would set might not be attainable for some students."
6822,ded3cfcb0c0f,"For example, a student would not be able to keep up with an at-home project if they were away for the majority of their summer."
6823,ded3cfcb0c0f,"Rather if they were to choose their own project, they could more easily manage how to carry out the project in consideration of their personal circumstance."
6824,ded3cfcb0c0f,"In general, students would be better at following their own judgment when creating and completing their own project."
6825,ded3cfcb0c0f,"Without any teachers to answer their questions over the summer, it is better for the students to be their own bosses."
6826,2d02e6a9d304,"If students were to create their own parameters for a summer-long project, it would be easier to manage because the students would be more knowledgeable of the requirements than if the project were assigned by a teacher."
6827,900d9b608a2f,Leaving a student to create and complete their own summer-long project would instill responsibility.
6828,900d9b608a2f,"At an age of maturation, students need to learn how to be self-sufficient."
6829,d45fe6ca8640,The responsibility of a summer-long project is comparable to that which is handled in the regular education students go through the other three seasons of the year.
6830,d45fe6ca8640,Students must learn to make decisions for themselves in school as they would have to for a summer project.
6831,d45fe6ca8640,A self-assigned project teaches many of the qualities innate to being an functioning adult.
6832,d45fe6ca8640,Many people must work by their own deadlines to make a living.
6833,d45fe6ca8640,"Without responsiblity, which is taught be self-assigned summer projects, people would not be able to hold jobs to pay bills."
6834,d45fe6ca8640,The long vacation over summer is a oppertune time to hone personal skills necessary to getting by and thriving in life.
6835,51e72e83a1f1,"Through a self-created project, students can best investigate their personal intersets by setting and managing their own goals while developing responsibility along the way."
6836,51e72e83a1f1,"When students can take it upon themselves to improve their education while on their summer break, they can find success and personal enrichment while still enjoying their vacation"
6837,f5866424b136,I personally would prefer for my project to be a student designed
6838,6bdbe55d8a5d,"you can choose from a variety of ideas,"
6839,0e5b100fea79,"it would show more creative projects,"
6840,85a91fa599cd,it would be different ideas
6841,250c887fa97a,having a project to do over summer break is a great Idea to keep students brains functioning.
6842,250c887fa97a,If the project is teacher designed all students would have the same topic.
6843,fc712f903e58,with the project being student designed it would be more creative for students.
6844,b78a6c10d4a2,"different students are going to do their projects on different topics, If I had to do this project I would be very creative, And show lots of neatness, Also I would turn my project in on time."
6845,56f336612291,with the project being student designed it would be a lot of different ideas students can choose from
6846,05e652297906,student would also have time on their projects.
6847,d3cf74a7756a,having a project over summer break is a good opportunity for students it wouldn't hurt to learn while on break
6848,de15f954ca72,The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.
6849,de15f954ca72,NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditiond on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.
6850,de15f954ca72,"If you image blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or more miles above the roiling Venusian landscap, it would be a shocker."
6851,de15f954ca72,"Temperatures would still be tasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would ber close to the level of the sea and Earth."
6852,1e64776a98da,"I think the autors statement on this is that when the temperature drops its very hard to communitcate with people going up there, but when it cools down its better for them."
6853,b85cd989864c,The Earth and Beyond it should not be limited by dangers and douts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.
6854,b85cd989864c,There devices were the first envisioned in the 1800s an playedan important role in the 1940's during World War ll.
6855,b85cd989864c,"The thoughts of computers in those days did caulations for them, which in today's years we know thing about."
6856,b85cd989864c,Many of the reserchers of the NASA is working on other approches to studying Venis.
6857,b85cd989864c,Like some are simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus' surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditiond.
6858,b85cd989864c,There a lot of projects that there looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers.
6859,b85cd989864c,"Using mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."
6860,d35464cc8725,I think the rock that landed in mars was meybe because it had came from a diffrent place or maybe because the rock was to old or to heavy.
6861,ac09cdb477b9,The rock may have move to Mars or landed in Mars maybe because something hit it and it just went to a diffrent place and it landed in Mars.
6862,ac09cdb477b9,The rock maybe have laded and make or had a face shape from the way it landed.
6863,ac09cdb477b9,Im not so sure if it had landed like that to make a face shape.
6864,ac09cdb477b9,"That's what I am thinking, is that it was like that from the way it had moved or it had changed."
6865,ac09cdb477b9,Some pople are surprised that they haved found a human face in the or in a planet.
6866,ac09cdb477b9,I know its kinda wierd but u never know what could happen.
6867,ac09cdb477b9,They say it had a human face.
6868,ac09cdb477b9,They say it had eyes and it had a nose and it had a mouth in the face.
6869,ac09cdb477b9,They should be scared because what if it was aliens that did that and that made the face.
6870,ac09cdb477b9,I would be scared but maybe it wasent the aliens maybe it was just regular.
6871,ac09cdb477b9,It just could've been Something regular or sothing natural that just happen.
6872,61e06d27d167,Student-designed summer projects would be more beneficial than teacher-designed
6873,d97e60ba7fd0,Students will have a wide variety of options to choose from
6874,1dd42b04a03e,Freedom to expresss themselves
6875,5259b5f7c0bb,their resources will be known.
6876,1374a2387e95,"Back then when I was in 4th grade almost every other weekend my aunt would take my cousin,brother and I to this frozen yougurt place in Generic_City."
6877,1374a2387e95,"The place was called frozen frog or something like that and we would just try all of the flavors when we got a chance it was amazing but we only could fill up the cup plus the toppings that we wanted,so we went ahead and made our choices and we said we would try something new the next time we went to that shop."
6878,1374a2387e95,Just like students we had the choice to do what we wanted to pick and get it done without someone else telling me to do what they wanted us to do.
6879,c601d8450db6,When I first started playing Mortal Kombat 11.
6880,c601d8450db6,I was so excited to try out all the new and old characters and see what new things they can do.
6881,c601d8450db6,I told myself I want to try and use different characters than the ones I use constantly.
6882,c601d8450db6,So I do so and realize that I never really play with Generic_Name or Generic_Name for some reason but then when I tried using them in a real fight it never really worked out.
6883,c601d8450db6,So I had convinced myself that it was all because I never learned their moves but then something hit me it wasn't that i haven't mastered their moves in such a small amont of time it was because their moves were just the same as Mortal Kombat X and I am not really good at working with close ranged fighters.
6884,c601d8450db6,My specialty was at fighting with those who can attack at any distance.
6885,c601d8450db6,Zoners were my best bet at winning any match.
6886,c601d8450db6,Also like students allowing people to see their limits can help others know what they are good at and what they aren't and they won't feel troubled because of a few minor things that were out of their control stop them from doing their job.
6887,93d8fa69a102,Truthfully it is just another way to tell someone no to doing this or that or it is a continuation of limiting people on their creativity.
6888,93d8fa69a102,Back in 6th grade most people had a problem with the art tecaher because she had such strict rules in a way it was either her way or the highway.
6889,93d8fa69a102,No one could really understand why she had us doing things this way or that way.
6890,93d8fa69a102,With that being said everyone was hoping that one day she would actually miss a day and one day she called out but then I looked around me everyone was having a fun time because they could express themselves through their art.
6891,93d8fa69a102,All students need to be able to express themselves without having someone telling them that they are doing things wrong.
6892,7a42f20f7a13,some people might say that is not true and if we allow students to do whatever they feel like doing then how are we suppose to make them do anything educational and how do you think it is going to help them in life.
6893,c2cf3bcdf424,allow some type of creativity in their life because you cannot tell me that you expect students to be told later on in the future to do this and this tep by step.
6894,c2cf3bcdf424,That is never gonna happen no one is ever gonna hold another persons hand all the days of their life thta is why they need a bit of freedom =now so they can have some experience with it when they get older.
6895,615ceef73c69,"Allow studnets to have freedom in their life without having to be forced to do things,Students will have a wide variety of options and their limits are know through their experiences."
6896,5025f99999ce,"Aliens, is this a realistic argument?"
6897,5025f99999ce,On the serface of mars there is somthing impiticular.
6898,5025f99999ce,It's somthing that looks like a face.
6899,5025f99999ce,NASA decided that this would be a good way to get peoples attention.
6900,5025f99999ce,"Now we are faced with the argument, could it have been aliens?"
6901,b4549a430ea8,the possibility of there being aleins is very unrealistic.
6902,b23048fd455c,the face could have just been another butte or mesa.
6903,79ac3adefe6a,The face could have just been a coincidence.
6904,9e1548117b94,"NASA, could just be saying this to get attention, but mabey not."
6905,9e1548117b94,"Even if there was alein landform on mars, we will not be able to know for sure"
6906,df9821b43464,"Like any history, we only know through drawings or writing,and the only evidence we have is this face."
6907,df9821b43464,Hopfully there will be more to find in near future.
6908,df9821b43464,Or mabey evcen drawings will appear that we can interpit.
6909,df9821b43464,"If not, then all of NASA still has evidence that there could be"
6910,5a0053b27740,"In conclusion, Mars will probably not hold anything else like this."
6911,5a0053b27740,"The picture may look like a face, but its more like mesa or butte."
6912,5a0053b27740,or will there be mystirious things like this again?
6913,5a0053b27740,Proving that it was not a coincedence.
6914,5a0053b27740,"Mabey NASA will find other things on different planets, or mabey not"
6915,d796fc160a3c,I am here because I am giving my opinion on whether students should have to participate in an extracurricular activity
6916,7f3a12cceea9,"I think that it would be good for students in many ways,"
6917,85e73e320241,they might make new friends.
6918,c75bbecbe894,This could happen because they would find other kids in they're group who enjoy the same things.
6919,c75bbecbe894,Having friends makes school a lot easier and more fun.
6920,c75bbecbe894,An extra bonus to having friends is that it is less likely for you to get bullied because you will have people to back you up.
6921,c75bbecbe894,Even outside of school having friends is good.
6922,c75bbecbe894,"Like if you want to play basketball but you arent on a team, well boom!"
6923,c75bbecbe894,you could go to a court with your friends to run some games.
6924,c75bbecbe894,In many ways having friends around will impact your life in good ways.
6925,62fb0a466c4c,Another good reason for having to do activities is you could find out that your really good at something
6926,e44cb1881126,"Like, what if you could play a mean harmonica without even knowing it?"
6927,e44cb1881126,You wouldn't have a clue unless you signed up for an extra activity.
6928,e44cb1881126,You might even be a good chess player.
6929,e44cb1881126,Im pretty good at chess and I wouldnt have known that unless I played a quick game with a friend.
6930,e44cb1881126,You could even make new friends with your newly discovered skills.
6931,e44cb1881126,"Some activities can help you later in life, like if you need to knit a rope because you got lost in a forest, or you need to know how to jump start a car because it broke down on the side of the road, well no problem you already know how to do it because of the activity."
6932,c82a66871dc6,You could have a lot of fun doing some activities.
6933,ad4c41cdeb7a,Having fun is important because you dont want to have suicidal thoughts or depression.
6934,ad4c41cdeb7a,Being depressed could easily lead to bad grades and poor choices.
6935,ad4c41cdeb7a,Having fun is good because your life will just be better.
6936,ad4c41cdeb7a,You can do tons of things to have fun or be happy.
6937,ad4c41cdeb7a,"Maybe your fun is reading, well then you could sign up for a book club."
6938,ad4c41cdeb7a,"I have fun playing sports like basketball, or baseball."
6939,ad4c41cdeb7a,"I like getting fresh air, so I play outside a lot."
6940,ad4c41cdeb7a,"Again, having fun is so important it makes you want to try more things."
6941,ad4c41cdeb7a,"Having fun can make people like you more so it could lead to you getting more friends, and having friends is also very important."
6942,4dbc89891b04,every student should be forced to do extracurricular activities.
6943,4dbc89891b04,I definitely think it would help out tons of kids to do it.
6944,2472cd72a0f9,Although many may say that there would be nothing to gain by researching Venus.
6945,2472cd72a0f9,There would be something gained when researching Venus
6946,0d43adf75593,such as the history of Venus.
6947,87b261a88fc0,Another would be the disigning of better stronger drone.
6948,9a33f517d087,The last reason would be to learn safe ways to stay on planets simular to Venus
6949,2724d55c2b1d,The know history of planets can teach us what we can do to help our own planet and what to avoid doing
6950,ded8e4e28a6f,"Stated in the article ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth"" the quote could teach us what not to do or we could end up near or similer to Venus."
6951,ca14fd59f0f8,Disigning better stronger drones that survive harder condicions such as Venus is a good thing because there could be other planets that could require that type of drone.
6952,7e22eaa993e7,"Stated in the article ""coulds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."
6953,7e22eaa993e7,"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."""
6954,7e22eaa993e7,Scientists could find a planet that could be similer or alike to Venus and they may need a drone strong enough to survive the harsh conditions on the planet.
6955,4750643989d2,Suvival on different planets that a scientist is researching is important and learning how to survive on Venus could be the first step.
6956,8a43f8d71fa0,"Can you imagine a computer guessing everyones emotions, and tell wether their sad, happy, confused, etc."
6957,8a43f8d71fa0,Well a 3-D computer can model all 44 major muscles.
6958,7cd454583dce,"Dr. Paul Echman the creater of FACS has classified six basic emotions happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."
6959,7cd454583dce,"using video imagery the computer can track these facial movements, the software can even recongnise mixed emotions."
6960,7cd454583dce,Inorder to identify all movements of one or more muscles is called an action unit.
6961,7cd454583dce,Using video imagery and recognising the facial movements the software can identify mixed emotions each expression is compared against a nuetral face.
6962,7cd454583dce,"Every human can make the same face everyday, but you can probably tell when your friend is sad or happy just by looking at their face."
6963,7cd454583dce,"While for somepeople its hard to tell when their friends feel happy, sad, confused etc."
6964,7cd454583dce,Dr. Huang got a picture of the Mona Lisa and made people look at it to tell if a computer can recognize your feelings.
6965,7cd454583dce,"They also showed people a web ad that appears on a computer screen, If the person frowned the ad would change and when you smile a similar ad would appear."
6966,7cd454583dce,Dr. Huang predicts that a classroom computer will recognize when a staudent is becoming bored or confused.
6967,3d16e6116702,This is an essay about Venus.
6968,3d16e6116702,In this essay I am going to tell you about the Venus an is it worth pursuit despite all the dangers
6969,a65b46fe5f17,Venus is to me is yes it is worth pursuiting despite all of its dangers to the human life form
6970,fbbcdf99c321,I belive this cause how are we ever going to know the truth if we don't go and find it out for ourselfs
6971,37f58d4d3b99,What really extist was there once life form on Venus.
6972,37f58d4d3b99,If so whendid they die or are they still there
6973,34b6bd35d362,See we will never uncover the truth if we dont break out of our shell and go exporing to the unknown we have to do it.
6974,34b6bd35d362,Nobody esle is going to go out into space and find out what is really up in space.
6975,fecfbf59111b,"We have our theory about other life out in space, of the once vallys, mountains and the carter on the surface of Venus so that we have our theory that once a long long time ago there once were a form of life on Venus"
6976,bef46e4d7f0b,"Now we have to think about how they lived, how they got their food, how they did all the thing sthat we as humans do but on a planet that has low gravit pulling you down."
6977,bef46e4d7f0b,On Earth we have a greater about of gravit pull us down to the ground than Venus does.
6978,bef46e4d7f0b,"Earth has also more water than Venus does now, but what if that was to change ."
6979,bef46e4d7f0b,What if the planet Venus had more water than Earth.
6980,bef46e4d7f0b,What if Venus and better things than Earth does.
6981,bef46e4d7f0b,Then why did Venus died what had to happen to whipe out and whgole plant that had maybe life form of some sort and that we know had water and enough oxygen to have the livingh life form of some kind to kive there.
6982,bef46e4d7f0b,So what did happen to the planet Venus.
6983,bef46e4d7f0b,How did this onbce living planet now become with no life form of any kinds
6984,5995e1dddde4,The only danger of this idea of going to the planet Venus is that what if they don't make it home.
6985,c0a0beda0398,Whatif ther are other life form living on Venus still but we just dont know what they are or how they came about there are hunders of thing that we as human we have not yet discover.
6986,c0a0beda0398,An maybe will never discover about how we got to where we are today.
6987,c0a0beda0398,How we have got what we have today.
6988,c0a0beda0398,These are thing that we may never truthy understand about where we came from.
6989,c0a0beda0398,"How we got to this day in time and how are we going to live these thing are unknown, till the end of time."
6990,e890c20f6b77,The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because the planet itself is dangerous
6991,54d7b219642d,"Venus is the same as the Earth, I mean it is reffered to as Earth's ""twin"", but there both the same only because of the density and size."
6992,54d7b219642d,"Both planets do have the same shape and density, but planet Earth is much more safer than Venus."
6993,80642772370d,"Venus has a thick atmoshpere, so it makes it harder to breathe."
6994,978ae2b1e99b,"For example, in the text it says,"" a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus."
6995,978ae2b1e99b,"Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."""
6996,978ae2b1e99b,It's impossible for somoene to even live on Venus because of it's own atmosphere.
6997,79530e19b3b8,Exploring and studying the planet Venus is actually challenging when you think about it
6998,05fee23a3411,"People tried to study about the planet, people have tried to explore, but in the end, it ends up failing."
6999,05fee23a3411,"For example, in the text it states, "" since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours."
7000,05fee23a3411,Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades.
7001,05fee23a3411,"Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us."""
7002,05fee23a3411,This is explaining how bad the planet really is.
7003,e8113711adb2,No spacecraft can even touch the ground on planet Venus
7004,9c689768c5a6,The reason why no spacecraft has touched down on planet Venus is because of the clouds itself.
7005,9c689768c5a6,"For example, in the text it explains,"" the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."
7006,9c689768c5a6,"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmoshpheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet."""
7007,9c689768c5a6,"Venus has a temperature of 800 degrees fahrenheit, while Earth's highest temperature is at least 110 to 120 degrees."
7008,9c689768c5a6,"So planet Venus is very hot, that probably explains why no spacecraft can land on the planet because it's so hot in the planet that the clouds trap all that heat inside."
7009,6fcbdd743b8e,"In conclusion, these are the reasons why the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."
7010,c9a48722276e,I'm a scientist at NASA and I know that the face is just a natural landform.
7011,c9a48722276e,"I have plenty of reasons why that is, and why it wouldn't be an alien."
7012,c9a48722276e,"Yes, the face on Mars has become a pop icon, but that doesn't mean people could just assume it's an alien."
7013,ce0ab7ec0e4e,NASA has plenty information and data for why it's just a natural landform.
7014,4cd6dcdaf450,My first reason is that NASA unveiled the image for all to see.
7015,4cd6dcdaf450,"The picture noted a huge rock formation which seemed to be a human head that had eyes, nose, and mouth."
7016,dd7284a87c8b,"You just have to think about it, those characteristics are obvious."
7017,dd7284a87c8b,"I mean yes, it was found in Mars, but that doesn't mean it couldn't have been a human."
7018,dd7284a87c8b,"People just have to think more into the possible and not the impossible, because everything is possible."
7019,735f3fbae9a1,My second reason is that they photographed the face.
7020,735f3fbae9a1,Other scientists at NASA saw that it clearly looked like a human head.
7021,a85c441a1ca1,My third reason is that they even snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos
7022,33795ef39a15,"When the image first appeared on a JPL web site, it clearly revealed a natural landform."
7023,33795ef39a15,There was no alien monument after all.
7024,74c194343a76,"This is why I, as a scientist at NASA think it's a natural landform and not an alien ."
7025,74c194343a76,these three reasons I have should make people think about it again and decide it's officially a human head.
7026,74c194343a76,"Those who believe it's an alien, should believe more in miracles."
7027,74c194343a76,Anything could happen in Mars or any other place around the planet.
7028,74c194343a76,"This is only my opinion, but it sure makes me feel like I'm right about my thinking."
7029,87f347ccbf49,"In 1973, the first handheld cell phone was made."
7030,87f347ccbf49,"23 years later, the first ever flip phone was introduced to the public."
7031,87f347ccbf49,"Cell phones have come a long way since they were first invented, and today people rely on them for more than just communication."
7032,87f347ccbf49,Smartphones.
7033,87f347ccbf49,"For instance, can do anything you can imagine, and we rely on them so much there's no telling where we would be without them."
7034,87f347ccbf49,"In fact, people use their cell phones practically 24/7."
7035,87f347ccbf49,"People text on the toilet, stream music in the shower, and unfortunately, use their phones while driving."
7036,87f347ccbf49,This is probably the worst thing about cell phones.
7037,87f347ccbf49,Phone related car crashes are one of the most common causes of fatalities in teens and adults.
7038,87f347ccbf49,1.6 million crashes a year are the result of people using their phones while driving.
7039,6c4593c54581,"No one, not even the most skilled driver in the world should be able to use a cell phone in any way while driving."
7040,986542f5604c,It's not always easy to control a vehicle.
7041,986542f5604c,"Weather conditions, traffic, and other people make driving very difficult sometimes."
7042,986542f5604c,"If you add the distraction of a cell phone, driving is 10 times more difficult to focus on."
7043,ff686a388a59,You've probably seen someone text and drive.
7044,ff686a388a59,"In the few seconds they take to glance away from the road and at their phones, a car crash could happen."
7045,ff686a388a59,It only takes one second for your car to swerve into the other lane.
7046,ff686a388a59,"Phones should never be used while driving for many reasons, and the main reason being that it is extremely dangerous."
7047,ff686a388a59,Texting and driving makes you 23% more likely to get in an accident.
7048,ff686a388a59,It's so much smarter to wait until you've reached your destination to use your phone.
7049,ff686a388a59,"If you can't wait, you can pull over on the side of the road."
7050,ff686a388a59,"If not, you could greatly risk your life."
7051,8523ab151d51,Another important reason why operating a phone while driving should be prohibited involves other drivers as well as passengers that may ride in your car.
7052,9fc4772feb45,"When someone rides in your vehicle, whether its a friend or your child, you are responsible for them."
7053,9fc4772feb45,"By using your phone at the wheel, you put both you and your passengers at risk of injury or even death."
7054,9fc4772feb45,You also put the strangers driving beside you at risk.
7055,9fc4772feb45,Texting and driving doesn't just risk you.
7056,9fc4772feb45,Most fatal car crashes involve more than one car.
7057,9fc4772feb45,"If you don't want to live with the fact that you hurt someone you love or even just a stranger, using your phone while driving shouldn't be an option."
7058,286ea8fabc39,"Lastly, in some states, using your phone while driving is illegal and can cost you a lot of money"
7059,6fed7dc6ab29,"In georgia, for instance, holding a cellphone while not parked, or even pressing one button on a phone can get you a ticket."
7060,6fed7dc6ab29,"With each offense, the fines get larger."
7061,6fed7dc6ab29,It's not worth paying a large ticket to send a short text message.
7062,6fed7dc6ab29,"Additionally, if someone dies in a car crash because of your actions, such as texting and driving, you could be charged with vehicular manslaughter and go to jail for up to 20 years."
7063,6fed7dc6ab29,"Texting and driving tickets, if shown on a police report for a wreck you are responsible for, will greatly increase your insurance rates, making your life a lot harder than it was before you decided to text and drive."
7064,6fed7dc6ab29,"Unless you have a money tree in your backyard and don't mind ridiculous insurance for the rest of your life, its best to wait until you get home to use your phone."
7065,897b97095c89,"In conclusion, it's hard to imagine why anyone would think using a phone while driving is a good idea."
7066,897b97095c89,Nothing good can come from texting or talking on the phone behind the wheel.
7067,897b97095c89,The best decision anyone can make is to completely forget about their phones while driving and focus on the road.
7068,897b97095c89,"You risk so many things by using your phone while operating a vehicle.. You risk your life, your friends life, strangers lives, and even the money in your pocket."
7069,897b97095c89,The only exception to being on a phone while driving should be to report an emergency.
7070,897b97095c89,"Otherwise, the use of a cell phone is risky and should be completely banned all over the world."
7071,897b97095c89,Statistics alone should be enough to open people's eyes to the dangers of using their phone in the car.
7072,897b97095c89,Phones are distracting and without a doubt should not be used while operating a vehicle.
7073,2c1a483382d6,Do you ever want to do something fun at your school that you really like?
7074,2c1a483382d6,"Well you came to the right school, cause the principal made a rule that you either have to play a sport or join a club that you like."
7075,2c1a483382d6,"You could play on a basketball team

You could play on a football team

You could play on a flag football team

You could play on a baseball team

You could play on a softball team

You could play for a soccer team you could join a cheering team"
7076,199bbe0f3729,I agree with the principal
7077,00d34ed71058,hen we get home we don't do anything and kids are lazy nowadays.
7078,00d34ed71058,"We either take a nap, eat, watch YouTube, or play video games."
7079,e96f34ab13c0,Also it will give kids a chance to have fun
7080,17f78eb97960,make new friends
7081,aaf938ed643d,see what they like so they can do it the future.
7082,6d2382ffc3fd,"kids are overweight, they're lazy, most of them won't do anything cause they are out of shape."
7083,7e785b818266,Probably the first thing they do when they get his eat and play video games and watch YouTube.
7084,7e785b818266,"So that is why the principal put in the new rule, they could make new friends while they're after school or join something their friends are in."
7085,7e785b818266,Also it will be good if your going to play in high school sports cause you already known what it takes to be on the sport team.
7086,32f3e41efef5,It is really fun cause you when you play a game that is home you will feel good cause everyone from your school is there cheering you on.
7087,266a49b78829,Also if you win your game at home it feels nice cause everyone is cheering your team on and then when you go back to school everyone will be taking about the win.
7088,266a49b78829,"If you don't believe me ask anyone that plays/played for a school team, most likely your parents played for a school team both of my parents did."
7089,e13c4a144385,"If your not interested in sports you could do other afters school activities like

Book club

Yearbook club

Dance club

Cooking club

Computer club

Student council

Engineering club

You could do those clubs in stead of playing sports"
7090,a70408cfc9f9,You could also do many other things that you like if you don't like any of this thing.
7091,a70408cfc9f9,Ask your teacher if you could make club and if she says yes go to her office.
7092,a70408cfc9f9,"If you don't like your club cause everything was filled it is fine, cause you could join it the next semester but you have to be one of the first to sign the sign-up sheet."
7093,a70408cfc9f9,"Also you be given a snack at the beginning of your after school period you could choose anything and, if you take the bus it will be there so you can go home."
7094,4a81fd873c9a,But if you don't take the bus you will have to be picked up by 4:30 and then you be home and do whatever you want to do.
7095,4a81fd873c9a,But if your parent can pick you after school you could leave at the normal time school gets out and if your not feeling good you could also leave at the normal time.
7096,4a81fd873c9a,But before you could anything you have to do your homework and then go to your after school club.
7097,495fd4582f79,"If you don't want to go you will have to go to the principal and explain why you can't,"
7098,985fea4f63a9,if it is a dumb reason you will have to go to after school.
7099,985fea4f63a9,Like if you have a broken leg and you play on a sport team you could still go to practice and see what they are doing and see al the drills they are doing.
7100,985fea4f63a9,Also if you fake an injure and the teacher find your big trouble cause you not listening to the principal.
7101,40dd1f54de8b,But you could get kicked out if your being bad and you will have to serve a punishment cause your still on school grounds.
7102,40dd1f54de8b,Like you you hit a student you will get suspended but if you hit the teacher you will get expelled.
7103,40dd1f54de8b,"If your playing sports it is all year long until the season ends, if your coach finds out your is taking drugs you will get kicked of the team."
7104,40dd1f54de8b,You will have the same rules as a high school cause you probably play for the high school team.
7105,40dd1f54de8b,But it won't costs any money cause the principal made us join the clubs so we could do something after school.
7106,40dd1f54de8b,Most likely we will find our hobby forever cause we are going to do it for the rest of the semester.
7107,40dd1f54de8b,If you find something that someone is doing and you want to do it just tell the teacher cause they will put you guys together.
7108,8b21dc954598,"If you still don't agree with me you should just try it out cause it fun,"
7109,dcc7f88f5842,"You could have fun, make new friends and bond over things you all like."
7110,dcc7f88f5842,Like sports if you join one of the sport teams you could meet someone with same interest like you.
7111,dcc7f88f5842,"Same with all the other club that the school is providing to the students, like book club you could like the same book as someone else and be best friend over that one book cause you joined the book club."
7112,dcc7f88f5842,I met one of my best friend through basketball and we liked other stuff that wasn't basketball related.
7113,a623272da8bf,Most likely you won't like it at first but then when your half-way through the year you will love it.
7114,1e62eaaa0702,Most of the time I join a club that i like cause it fun to meet new people that have the same interest as you.
7115,1e62eaaa0702,Sometimes the club isn't fun but that is okay cause you could join a new one.
7116,1e62eaaa0702,Most of the time everyone will be shy at the beginning cause no one knows each other but half way through the semester you will known everyone.
7117,1e62eaaa0702,"Cause everyone won't be shy cause they will see you everyday plus, when your in school at lunch and you don't known anyone and you see one of those people you could sit with them."
7118,1e62eaaa0702,When you meet a new person they will have friends so you could more friends when the new person shows you to them.
7119,d926d0172568,So what we know is that joining an after school program could give you a lot of benefits and friend.
7120,d926d0172568,Also they is a lot of clubs and sports you could join for fun.
7121,d926d0172568,Also eat a free snack so your not hungry when you get home to your parents.
7122,5a58186b08ae,This story is about a new technology that is called a Facial Action coding system that are able able to recognize other people faces.
7123,5a58186b08ae,I'm explaining what I think about people using a facial recognition.
7124,d3626df5dc1a,This whole facial recognition thing is awesome and I think that it is safe for us humans.
7125,23e4d297fc5d,These people can actually use it for there iphones now.
7126,23e4d297fc5d,"For example a person uses a facial recognition for his phone,that's good because because can't nobody else can get into his device."
7127,23e4d297fc5d,The thing about it is who was the person to come up with this idea I think its cool but there using up all this technology.
7128,23e4d297fc5d,I think that there is a reason for everything and I wonder what made that that person come up with that idea.
7129,a0e96bfd768f,Another reason why I think this is a cool idea is because it knows who you are even when you have on different face expression
7130,a35db74f6afe,That's amazing how a computer can express how we feel .I 'm so surprized that a computer can do that.
7131,a35db74f6afe,I some time ask myself how do they do that.
7132,787815f1195b,I think that computers would need a lot of energy to do that I don't know it's amazing.
7133,787815f1195b,I sometimes think that it is not impossible for this to happen but it really is.
7134,787815f1195b,I think about all the gadgets that my mom had back then.
7135,787815f1195b,I would usually say that they're going to make alot of different things in the future.
7136,787815f1195b,Their already trying to make self-driving cars.
7137,787815f1195b,This story is amazing.
7138,787815f1195b,I think that there are going to be more things that are going to surprise me.
7139,787815f1195b,This one is the first greatest techonolgy I ever heard about.
7140,787815f1195b,When I grow up I dont want to use all of this technology because I think that it is to much for me.
7141,787815f1195b,I would consider only using something simple.
7142,34c743b786a0,This story told me alot.
7143,34c743b786a0,It told me what a computer could do that i never knew about which is surprizing.
7144,34c743b786a0,I just told my story about how i'd feel about all this new technology.
7145,34c743b786a0,That story was interesting and I think that I would probably use that one day.
7146,34c743b786a0,If I would use it I would be careful with it.
7147,12de31ee437f,in the beginning of the story it is saying that the people and cars are able to work together because it will stay there and be with them most of that.
7148,b0f05ca484e0,Then there are the casws of the underly populate areas in a city so they might go and vreate an area for them to live and play around in.
7149,b0f05ca484e0,They might have just gotten taken in as if the were to go and drive or even walk with them for as long as possnle.
7150,b0f05ca484e0,Then there are the way some of them that are driving a certain car for a time being until they were able to help the enviornment that is neer by.
7151,b0f05ca484e0,Then in the second passage it is saying that people will try to use there cars less so that the smog will go fading little by little or is it going to start to disapate.
7152,b0f05ca484e0,I must say that it might take a while until they might have made it at the time they could have done it so they might even try to create a day when no one will be using a car so they might get a better life and they might be able to pervent smog also and they might get to a part of the atmoshere and depleat the ozone layer making the sun even harsher for us.
7153,b0f05ca484e0,So these are the things about the people that were trying to stop the bad effects on the inviornment.
7154,fb57cfa14396,If I was arguing with some one that the face on mars was not real and that it was some thing that just happend on its own I think that it could go both ways and that it could of been an alien but it really just probly happend on its own.
7155,c67b37a17a1b,We could argue and argue about this subject but if I was a scientist I would make a camera that could go farther and depper into mars outmasphere so we could see what was going on for some days to mounths to see what would happen if nothing happend then I would be right if we seen aliens there then he would be right.
7156,c67b37a17a1b,But it would be alot easyer said then done to make that camera that can go that far into space to see that much for that long it would not be a easy task.
7157,c67b37a17a1b,But for the sack of seeing if aliens were real then it would be worth making to see if aliens are real or not.
7158,c67b37a17a1b,Because that would change every thing that we now about a different life force then use.
7159,c67b37a17a1b,It would blow up I would become famus nowing im the one that made the camera.
7160,76ac71c88f72,And not even that i would prove that guy in the lab wrong that it is not even aliens that it is just sand and rock.
7161,5097cde6e866,But It would be pretty cool to see aliens and we only seen this way back in 1976 I wonder how long it has been there it could be billions to only 40 years old.
7162,5097cde6e866,But i would get to work to see if i could build the camera to send to mars and see what was going on on mars.
7163,5097cde6e866,And if I was to build it and if it would work I would keep it there on mars untill it ran out of battries and if there was yto be nothing then I would be right but if there was to besomething then that guy from the lab would of been right.
7164,b4cf1f69f8ac,But that is what i woud do if I was a sientist that worked for NASA abd there was a big argument about what it was then that is what I would do to see just make a camera to see which one was right me or the guy in the lab.
7165,b4cf1f69f8ac,Hopfully I would even be able to build that if i was a scientist that worked for NASA.
7166,2ab294314397,The implications of technology that can detect emotions simply by reading the muscles in the face sound truly remarkable.
7167,2ab294314397,"The thought that one can tell what another is thinking simply by plugging data or maybe even a picture into an algorithm sounds like fiction, but may soon be a reality."
7168,2ab294314397,"The article, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto briefly discusses the possible use of such technology in a classroom."
7169,2ab294314397,"The system could examine student's faces, and if they read to be unengaged or uninterested, could adjust the lesson to make learning more interesting to that group of students."
7170,2ab294314397,"That type of technology could revolutionize learning, and customly tailor lesson plans to the feelings of students on any given day."
7171,99ceb1521d47,"Technology that reads people's emotions would be beneficial in a classroom setting,"
7172,df593d6509f3,because it would adjust lesson plans
7173,66ff7163be95,"make learning more fun,"
7174,dd93689a7c04,and could also help students struggling to focus in class.
7175,e753f5db6d3f,The technology to read emotions would greatly change the way students learn.
7176,e753f5db6d3f,"If a teacher used this technology and noticed that all of his students were bored and uninterested, he could alter the lesson plan to make it more fun"
7177,52d28d739427,"Not all students will feel the same, though, which is also where this technology could come in."
7178,52d28d739427,"At the beginning of a school year, perhaps, the teacher could use the technology on the class to see how they feel about the particular subject."
7179,52d28d739427,"Then, the students who are excited about the subject and show interest could be sorted into a class that can be run in a way that makes the class educationally suitable for students who actually want to learn that subject."
7180,52d28d739427,"The students that do not show as much interest, or none at all, could be sorted into a seperate class that makes the subject more fun, but still teaches the same points as the other class."
7181,0ac1d80684ca,Another application of such technology in the classroom could help to make learning overall more fun for all students
7182,9220c1ad0731,"If many students start to become bored, then the teacher could come up with a quick game to enrich the learning experience."
7183,9220c1ad0731,"If many of the students are already interested with the subject matter, the teacher may not have to do as much adjusting."
7184,9220c1ad0731,"If the students need to be enriched with games and activities, now the teacher will immeditely know."
7185,9220c1ad0731,"This could overall make learning a lot more fun, but introducing more games and activities into the curriculum as see fit."
7186,9220c1ad0731,"If the students want to play knowledge enriching games, they can just show disinterest, and the system would pick that up and inform the teacher."
7187,9220c1ad0731,The technology to read student's emotions in the classroom as a very basic level could make learning more fun and personal to the student.
7188,091e678c6f8c,Reading students emotions would also be helpful to identify those students who are struggling to focus or simply understand the material being presented to them in class
7189,793ea05af023,"If a student shows confusion or discontent, it may be able to pick that up and show the teacher specific students that need help."
7190,793ea05af023,"The teacher could take the student aside and ask if they need help, and then adjust their learning accordingly."
7191,793ea05af023,Another way this technology could help struggling students is to set them up with tutors that are doing well in the class.
7192,793ea05af023,"If a student is excited to learn consistantly during that class period, they could be sat next to a struggling student in order for the one not doing as well to recieve help from a peer."
7193,793ea05af023,The ability to read emotions in the classroom would help students who are struggling tremendously.
7194,8c11cc880c33,"Adjusting lesson plans, making learning more fun, and helping struggling students are three of the main reasons in which emotion-reading teachnology would be amazing to introduce into the classroom."
7195,8c11cc880c33,"The students would control the class, not the teacher, and it would make the learning experience more customized to each particular class."
7196,8c11cc880c33,"As well, it would allow for more interesting games and activities to be introduced into the curriculum in order to keep learning entertaining and entriching."
7197,8c11cc880c33,"Students who struggle with particular subjects would be able to recieve help using the technology, and the teacher would not have to guess which students are struggling only based on grades."
7198,8c11cc880c33,"The technology of emotion-reading should be applied to all classrooms when it becomes widely available, because it could help both teachers and students improve the learning environment."
7199,c2b660e60c0a,You should particpate in the Seagoing Cowboys program.
7200,460a08f7a2aa,It is a great way to get out and help people

7211,8909e8f33c09,That what would be fun.
7212,792333cb4aaf,"we need more people to take care of are plant, and go do things that can help it."
7213,2464a2e6f14d,This could help it so much.
7214,2464a2e6f14d,We could change people's lives by doing this.
7215,2464a2e6f14d,"This is a important job for people, because it could keep people from dieing."
7216,b9fc4fdfa763,You should join the Seagoing Cowboys.
7217,b9fc4fdfa763,It is fun and you can help people.
7218,b9fc4fdfa763,It also can change lives in a good way and keep people from starvation.
7219,b9fc4fdfa763,"I hope you join, becaues we need you too."
7220,4ad039b0e44c,I always did love taking care of animals and doing other stuff as a crew of the Seagoing Cowboys.
7221,4ad039b0e44c,I am here because many people argue whether be a Seagoing Cowboys is something you should do.
7222,17aa926ab3d6,I believe that being a Seagoing Cowboy is worth the risk
7223,7beb74b67ce4,help people
7224,78754b2dc95a,just have fun.
7225,6aa2dd7319d4,Helping people in need is really what matters in lfe
7226,49bd4b3b2427,Its really in every human job there is.
7227,49bd4b3b2427,"A dentist helps your teeth keep clean, a teacher helps you learn, and a mechanic helps you fix your car."
7228,49bd4b3b2427,Almost every human job out there is all about helping people.
7229,49bd4b3b2427,In my case I got to help people in need after World War II .
7230,49bd4b3b2427,"I was in a group called UNRRA, which was a group who helped pople in animals and food supplies."
7231,49bd4b3b2427,I feel good now that I know I got to serve countries that were left in ruins.
7232,49bd4b3b2427,I am sure mighty proud that I became a Segoing Cowboy.
7233,49bd4b3b2427,It helped me realize that not only I need help but other people are also in need of help.
7234,ca99df24aae9,I also had lots and lots of fun while I was a Seagoing Cowboy.
7235,613c1fb0526e,"In case you ever got bored, there was no problem playing games."
7236,613c1fb0526e,There were so many to choose from.
7237,613c1fb0526e,"There was baseball, volleyball, table tennis, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling."
7238,613c1fb0526e,I was so entertained.
7239,613c1fb0526e,When we played games the time flew by as if it were a cheetah on the clock.
7240,613c1fb0526e,There was usually no way you could have got bored with all the choices you had as entertainment.
7241,613c1fb0526e,This is another reason why you should join Seagoing Cowboys.
7242,0a4a916aa732,I will warn there will be risks in doing this though.
7243,0a4a916aa732,"I know it sounds kind of dangerous,"
7244,1e3f89067f13,"I believe that it is worth it, and I would know."
7245,bba59760ca6b,"I once was night watchman, I had to check that every thing was going smoothly."
7246,bba59760ca6b,Everything was going okay untill I slipped on a ladder and fell on my backside.
7247,bba59760ca6b,"I was heading for a entrance at the side of the boat, but a small strip of metal stopped my slide."
7248,bba59760ca6b,I could have flown straight into the Atlantic Ocean.
7249,bba59760ca6b,I also had broken ribs so I coulndn't work
7250,72a7764fe55e,Even though this happened I am still very grateful that I am alive and still helping people in need.
7251,72a7764fe55e,I feel good putting my life at risk for millions of people in need.
7252,42d448731c3c,I know that there is risk but it is worth it.
7253,42d448731c3c,"You get to have fun and have a good feeling in your heart, all for just helping people in need."
7254,42d448731c3c,"I am grateful for the oppurtunity, and it made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs."
7255,42d448731c3c,I do believe that being a Seagoing Cowboy is worth it.
7256,42d448731c3c,Who knows maybe you'll become the next one.
7257,ab4749e87f80,"With a time like this, your country needs you most."
7258,071a06b8a879,That is one of the many reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys
7259,be824b49d679,you will see amazing sights
7260,a9f1f5e2898b,have fun while you work.
7261,91e008b3dbde,"When you join the program, you will have opportunities to see parts of the world you never thought you would see."
7262,101a1799d71a,"You will see Europe, China, and even Greece."
7263,101a1799d71a,"You an even take a gondala ride in Venice, Italy, or marvel at the sight of the Panama Canal."
7264,101a1799d71a,You can see th Acropolis in Greece and castles in Crete.
7265,101a1799d71a,But those are not the only benifits.
7266,de2100b10cf3,"Even tough taking care of animals is hard work, you still have time to have fun."
7267,9c58614054b6,"When we unload the animals, We often do things to pass the time where we used to keep them."
7268,9c58614054b6,"Games like baseball, volleyball, and even table-tennis tournaments."
7269,9c58614054b6,"We sometimes do boxing, fencing, whittling, reading, and other games."
7270,c408095d1ab2,When you join the Seagoing Cowboys you will open up a world of opportunities.
7271,c408095d1ab2,"But it is much more than just an adventure, it opens up the world to you."
7272,d32aee609ee3,Is there an advantage to limit the car usage
7273,ea86a6af6f7c,There alot of diffrent advantages
7274,6826ef3d5b63,promoting
7275,461645ee618c,protection
7276,439210ca27fb,bills
7277,9d31a2b95d4a,"the united states who is promoting the new communities that are less dependent on cars , (rosenthal) if you think about its a good thing because then it gives us less usage and thats a good thing not a bad thing for the people who think so its not .promoting is like you trying to sell somthing to someone and making it sell .thats what you call promoting somthing."
7278,9d31a2b95d4a,"the goal is to promote alterative transportation and reduce smog,(selsky)"
7279,e873aad94299,"If the usage is reduce then the the greenhouse gases will reduce emissions from tailpipes ,(rosenthal) and thats a good thing becuase if you think about it it cant be a bad thing and never will be a bad thing .The greenhouse gases are a good thingnot somthing bad it helps plants grow."
7280,e873aad94299,"Millions of colombians biked,skated or took buses ,(selsky) and that even uses less green house gases."
7281,3ea278b11acb,"There will be bills passed 80 percent of apprpiation have gone to highways and only 20 percent to other transport, (rosenthal) and that makes it better if we have bills passed because that mean that we can do more if the laws are passed by the government."
7282,3ea278b11acb,"It was the third year cars have been banned with only buses and taxis permitted for the day without cars,(selsky)."
7283,d378b53bb5c9,"the three advantages are that promoting , protection and the bills ."
7284,d378b53bb5c9,That all helps  limit the usage of the cars.
7285,d378b53bb5c9,well thats all for now.
7286,7160e4a9b009,"In America, we use vehicles on a daily basis to get around."
7287,7160e4a9b009,"You either drive a vehicle that you own, ride a bus, take a taxi, ride a bike, or walk."
7288,7160e4a9b009,"It is rare to see someone walking or riding a bike these days, but that is because we are so dependant on motor vehicles."
7289,7160e4a9b009,"If you take a look at other countries, you will realize that they are taking steps to cut back on the use of motor vehicles to help stop pollution."
7290,7160e4a9b009,"It is uncommon in the U.S. for a whole town of people to ""give up"" their cars, let alone pay $40,000 for a parking space and a house."
7291,7160e4a9b009,"In Vauban,Germany, this ""smart planning"" movement was introduced to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and the amount of cars in the area."
7292,7160e4a9b009,"""When I had a car I was always tense."
7293,7160e4a9b009,"I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter, a mother of two and media trainer."
7294,7160e4a9b009,70 percent of families living in Vauban do not own cars and walk or ride bikes to reach their destinations.
7295,7160e4a9b009,"The town is not completely ""car free,"" there is a main thoroughfare that runs from downtown Freiburg."
7296,7160e4a9b009,"Considering the town was only built about ten years ago, they are helping our environment in a big way."
7297,7160e4a9b009,"Smog is a big problem in Paris,France."
7298,7160e4a9b009,"After several days of ""near-record pollution,"" Paris temporarily baned driving to clear the cities air."
7299,7160e4a9b009,"About 4,000 drivers recieved a 22-euro fine and 27 of those drivers had their cars impounded because of their reaction to their fine."
7300,7160e4a9b009,The fine worked and the cities congestion was down to 60 percent after five days of the smog.
7301,7160e4a9b009,"The cities weather was part of the reason why there was so much smog, but some people believed it had to do with the diesel fuel that was used throughout France."
7302,7160e4a9b009,"The public transit was free from Friday to Monday, but the smog eventually cleared and the band was lifted."
7303,a322d301e71b,The author doesn't support his own idea
7304,bd39fb25ada5,He lists the good of what would happen with some facts
7305,addf745d3f98,The dangers are stacked high with exlporing Venus.
7306,addf745d3f98,"With the temperture on Venus at the surface being over 800*F which in a spacesuit can still fry a person alive, and the litteral aicd rain, could malt the suit and well there goes a dead man."
7307,addf745d3f98,"Even if we somehow manage to make a spacesuit that isn't going to melt or fry a person on Venus, then we can explore it."
7308,addf745d3f98,"Tech these days is our down fall, we create tech thatwe use everyday, but with all the space exploration that is our go to, because we don't have the tech now to send a person from one side of the galaxy to the other."
7309,addf745d3f98,Once we do that then we can explore.
7310,addf745d3f98,"Venus maybe closer to us, but there is no water present on the surface therefor no life could be living on that planet."
7311,addf745d3f98,"To study Venus we would have to send someone there to collect samples, at which they have about 80% chance of death right at the moment, and a 20% chance of living"
7312,26141b2dd44b,"Do we want to risk someone just to explore a plant, when we haven't fully explored ours?"
7313,26141b2dd44b,What sence does that make?
7314,4664053eac75,What is the reason why there is a face shape in Mars?
7315,4664053eac75,"No one know how it become a human face or if it a human face at all, and some think the reason behind it is that there are evidence showing live in Mars."
7316,8d03863e773c,"I agree that the shape is a human face shape, but I also believe is just a landform."
7317,fe587a7f805d,"The reason is that as it stated in the article, the face is to attrack the people."
7318,2f75ba376d93,"The first reason to support my claim is that the face is use to attrack people, so that the people who made up the idea can earn the money"
7319,bdb92882edd5,"According to paragraph three it said that,""huge rock formation.. which resembles a human head... formed by shadowss giving the illusion of eyes,nose and mouth."""
7320,bdb92882edd5,"Following the evidence is that also on paragraph three it say,"" The authors reasoned it would be a good way to enage the public and attract attention to Mars."""
7321,bdb92882edd5,"This evidence tell me that with the idea of having a human face in Mars, it allowed people to think and believe what they told them."
7322,dd903f7bd0fa,"On paragraph twelve, Garvin say that,"" It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho,that's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars."
7323,b8fb9e1794d4,The second reason is that the face was due to a land form.
7324,b8fb9e1794d4,"The evidence not only gave me the idea of how it was form, it also give me the idea of how it reminded them of the a real life thing happen in the United State."
7325,b8fb9e1794d4,We can already agree with this evidence that the idea of the formation for a human face was due to landforms.
7326,b8fb9e1794d4,Also when in a different planet landform are still the same as the earth by how the land change.
7327,4bfd4adce766,"There may be live in Mars, and no one know that is true."
7328,4bfd4adce766,"In any case the Face of Mars might looked like a real human face, but if you look closely at the face that viking take in 2001, it doesn't look like a face."
7329,4bfd4adce766,"In the picture it show how the landform change it, and that the reason for why there are no Face in Mars."
7330,4bfd4adce766,This argument will show you why the Face of Mars is just any landform like you see in earth.
7331,79fc7bf1ee76,"Students want summer to be homework free, and not have to worry about summer projects."
7332,79fc7bf1ee76,Most students will agree that summer is meant to give the brain a rest.
7333,79fc7bf1ee76,"Meant to give students time to have fun, be free, and enjoy the few months before school starts up again."
7334,6d5af9d56996,"Although some may disagree, schools should require summer work for students."
7335,44a9b3f54a95,"Students will come back to school from summer completely refreshed; however, if they don't do a summer project, they will feel lost."
7336,380855624d93,"Some schools require a book report, or some sort of homework from some of your classes."
7337,380855624d93,Those book reports and homework keep you from forgetting the essentials in learning.
7338,380855624d93,"The point is to make sure that there is some educational activity, and assure that students won't forget basic resources."
7339,380855624d93,Becoming lost mentally can feel like being dropped in a random part of the world.
7340,380855624d93,"Without having some sort of tracker to keep students focused over the summer, students would feel lost and confused when they came back."
7341,380855624d93,Recovering from being confused and lost is easier said than done.
7342,380855624d93,"As classes continue to progress, not knowing what happened before is brutal."
7343,380855624d93,Summer projects help prevent that with continual learning.
7344,2f656f751e57,Assigning the projects to students can show the teacher many things.
7345,dc55c6d66c10,Summer projects can show the teacher what type of learner their student is.
7346,dc55c6d66c10,"They can show what they've learned, their capabilities, and how much effort they put into their work."
7347,dc55c6d66c10,"Teachers want their students to pass, and care about all of their students."
7348,dc55c6d66c10,Summer projects are ways to learn about their students and follow their progress.
7349,dc55c6d66c10,Summer projects help students get prepared for the lesson they will learn.
7350,dc55c6d66c10,Students being prepared for an upcoming lesson is essential in order to not make the students feel confused at the beginning.
7351,dc55c6d66c10,A strong start to a school year can determine the rest of the year.
7352,dc55c6d66c10,Students don't know how much a summer project has taught them until the year starts.
7353,dc55c6d66c10,"When the student understands the lesson being taught, the school year will come much easier."
7354,6b66689eaa09,Summer projects are frowned upon by most students.
7355,6b66689eaa09,"Although some may disagree, schools should require summer work for students."
7356,6b66689eaa09,Students not feeling lost and keeping a influential mind set during summer is essential for a good school year.

7551,93a0404f6c19,"When assigned a project during summer break, don't you wish you could have control?"
7552,7ad7f10f50af,Students should be able to design their own projects
7553,d53fa254177c,it's their summer
7554,efa8b27936f3,"improve learning,"
7555,627bdf186c4a,students can be creative with it.
7556,44066cff14cc,When making a project these things are what you look forward too.
7557,44066cff14cc,Students need their minds to go wild and enjoy the project especially if it's over the summer.
7558,44066cff14cc,Their summer to be specific because no student would want to stay at home stuck doing a project if it's not fun for them.
7559,44066cff14cc,Especially if their friends are out having fun.
7560,6fb01a8a829a,it's their summer.
7561,bd107739df2e,"No student, in any grade, would want to be stuck with a project to do over their summer break or any break."
7562,bd107739df2e,Students dont even want homework over any type of brake.
7563,bd107739df2e,Therefor they should be able to design their projects.
7564,bd107739df2e,This should give them a little more freedom over break instead of being bored overall.
7565,bd107739df2e,It could help students have fun while doing their project as well as getting a good grade.
7566,4df60b8e1323,when doing a project it could help with bonding.
7567,5b1e1d92579d,This could work in one of two ways: The first being a family project and students get to do a family tree.
7568,5b1e1d92579d,And second being a group project and friends stay over each others houses and get to know each other more.
7569,5b1e1d92579d,In benefit of all this is making a new friend or friends.
7570,5b1e1d92579d,And a bonus is getting a good grade.
7571,5b1e1d92579d,Summer's are supposed to be spent with family and friends.
7572,5b1e1d92579d,Enabling students to design their own projects can open up so many new worlds.
7573,be2207e9aaf8,allowing students to design their projects will improve creativity.
7574,385ea5a76edc,What students look forward to in a project is how fun it could be or how much fun could they could get out of it.
7575,385ea5a76edc,So allowing students to design their projects can help improve not only creativity but learning.
7576,385ea5a76edc,Students want to go all out and when they get to see that opportunity it's amazing what students can do.
7577,385ea5a76edc,"It's overall amazing what is in a students mind, they just need to let it all out."
7578,385ea5a76edc,This also helps them as they arent pressured to stay in the standards of the project.
7579,354b438465f9,The only bad side anyone can possibly see in this is the topic.
7580,354b438465f9,"Students, when let lose, can tend to get off topic and not realize it."
7581,354b438465f9,They get to caught up in their mind that they lose what the requirements are.
7582,d14a46bff33a,This isn't a bad thing but it tends to happen.
7583,d14a46bff33a,Overall students want to have fun with learning.
7584,d14a46bff33a,It's already boring enough to do homework so cut the students some slack.
7585,fad33fed6369,students should be able to design their own projects.
7586,fad33fed6369,Its not only their summer but their time with family.
7587,fad33fed6369,"It could help bonding with not only family but with some new friends, and it could make summer a lot more fun."
7588,fad33fed6369,And also improve creativity as all students want to let their minds free when making a project.
7589,fad33fed6369,They want to see how much they could get out of something so making students design their projects is the best way to go.
7590,fad33fed6369,Let their mind flow and enjoy not only their project but summer as well.

7618,5ca45490fa74,"Through the school year students are required complete many learning based projects that are designed and instructed by teachers, but as the school year ends many teachers fear that students may lose the knowledge gained over the year during summer break."
7619,5ca45490fa74,To prevent this from happening many schools require summer projects that reinforce knowledge learned during the school year
7620,b0732090b707,"Many people argue if a teacher or student designed projects are more effective to help retain knowledge, but student designed projects are believed to be more effective."
7621,53badb80e093,"When a summer project is designed by a student it gives students a chance not only learn while completing the project, but to learn while making it"
7622,afccc765ae14,"students receive a real world experience,"
7623,833d8a79068b,students experience a sense of freedom
7624,f8fe9840ff6e,"During summer many students have the desire to quickly complete the assignment a teacher has assigned, by doing the bare minimum, but if the project was designed by the student themselves it would give them the opportunity to learn while both making and completing the project."
7625,f8fe9840ff6e,"When you develop a project, a lot of research is need to be conducted, this gives students an opportunity to absorb more information, then if they were just completing a project."
7626,3a06cf5353cb,"Designing a project also gives students knowledge in the topic their project is on, as well as skills on how to make projects and other important research based skills that are not focused on in school, but are necessary in higher level education."
7627,c3b607fc3889,"Not only do student designed projects give students an extra opportunity to learn, but it also provides students with a sense of real world experiences that enhance learning, and general skills."
7628,80a59defa723,"After high school graduation many colleges and universities require that students conduct research projects designed by themselves, in order to receive a degree."
7629,80a59defa723,"This may be very difficult for students coming from an environment were teachers design everything, but a student developed projects in school would give kids an experiences in this situation helping them latter in life, and making college projects easier to complete."
7630,80a59defa723,"Also, in many work environments employees are left on their own to complete tasks and projects, and an experience in designing your own project during school years would help people develop necessary skills for an post- graduation career, as well as high school or college jobs."
7631,80a59defa723,This experience would also gives students something to put under leadership on a college application.
7632,60b37e0d4eda,"Another essential impact of allowing students to design their own projects during summer, is that this allows students to develop a senses of freedom that is locked up during the long school year"
7633,f577329d33f6,"Throughout the school year teachers provide projects that are essential for learning the content, but prevents students form using there creativity and expanding on their freedom to think in different ways."
7634,f577329d33f6,"During the summer if students were allowed to develop their own projects they would feel more free, this would allow them to experiment with different ideas and concepts, this also would allow them to figure out which way they learn best."
7635,f577329d33f6,"While being away from an instructor such as a teacher, kids could use their own ideas to create a project, that is not influenced by others, and this would show schools and teacher how much a student truly understands not just the knowledge that a teacher is forcing upon them."

7637,9baa1a769622,"Summer break projects are one of the essential tools in preventing students form losing the knowledge that they difficulty gained throughout the year, and student designed projects provide a more effective alternative to the rigid teacher designed projects"
7638,0a701efe7ab5,"Many people may argue that teacher designed projects are the most educational and effective way to help students retain their knowledge, because they are made by experts in the subject, and are designed by adults, or that allowing students to develop their own projects is a waste of time,"

7641,3ee096053480,The Facial Action Coding System is useful in many ways when telling us someones facial expressions.
7642,1a2eb97d1f7b,The Facial Action Ciding System can help us indicate someones true fellings or emoions that they are felling or felling that they have torwds someone else.
7643,f38ec7062e1f,By looking at A computer it can indicate what your truely felling.
7644,f38ec7062e1f,When someone doesnt have A facial expression on thier face the Facial Action Coding System can identify what they are truely felling.
7645,00ec265a4f77,Making A facial expression everyday can help you produce the expression more often.
7646,ca337dbf0e88,Most the time whatever emotion your felling the more this emotion will pop up in your life time.

7650,421d704fd9b0,The author supports this idea by giving the facts of how dangerous it is but why we should keep trying to study Venus
7651,6808c31d8fa4,The author says a lot about the dangers because there are a lot.
7652,f4cc7b815ca8,we could find out more about these dangers and how to defeat them.
7653,f4cc7b815ca8,They set out on a mission to simulate the chaos of Venus's surface and it was able to last three weeks.
7654,7b017dd46b24,NASA is working on a lot of different approaches on how to last a while or have a good landing on Venus.
7655,b6f683577193,The author tells about the things that we could find out if we could be there for a while.
7656,b6f683577193,They stress a lot in the passage about it being the hottest planet around and it isn't even the closest to the sun.
7657,b6f683577193,This is a huge thing holding them back the author says and would melt almost all metal.
7658,b6f683577193,The author supports this by saying that a submarine that goes very deep in the ocean wouldn't even survive on Venus.
7659,b6f683577193,The author gives a lot of facts and things to support his claims.
7660,d43ae55a3546,If the author has told a fact they have had soemthing to support it.
7661,d43ae55a3546,The author says a lot about the things we can't do with Venus and has something to explain why with it.
7662,d43ae55a3546,The author had a lot of facts and examples to help him support his and NASA's facts and ideas.
7663,d43ae55a3546,I really like that the author will also give statistics because that is a huge way to support a fact or claim.
7664,d43ae55a3546,Overall in this whole passage the author supports all ideas.
7665,979be1d4bcbf,Facial Action Coding System I think is a good idea
7666,280cb078f9e1,because if someone is trying to figure out how you are feeling and you don't tell them they can look on the computer and tell what your emotions are
7667,4bb1674bb3e3,.
7668,4bb1674bb3e3,In the passage it tells that the computer is 3-D and has 44 major muscle.
7669,4bb1674bb3e3,This tell us that if a friend is feeling a way you can tell and you would actually know itts true and not false.
7670,4bb1674bb3e3,"In paragraph one it explains to me that there are six basic emotions and they are happiness, surprise , anger ,and ect."
7671,4bb1674bb3e3,For example your frontalis muscle above your eye raises your eyebrows when you are surprise.
7672,4bb1674bb3e3,Some people wouldnt think that this is possible but I think its something good.
7673,6cc385a3b9bd,When a student is looking at the computer they can pick up all emotions like if you have mixed emotions or just one.
7674,fecd321a7589,Someimes teachers want to know how they students are feeling but just don't want to walk up to the and just ask.
7675,fecd321a7589,This computer I think was a wonderful thing that someone can make.
7676,fecd321a7589,If I ever had this computer it would be very useful to me because want to know how others feel.
7677,17c78d2ac318,Some people who try to just look at someone and tell how they are feelings is not always helpful they might think its one thing but its another.
7678,360430e9b2b6,Most people are not just good by going off someone's look but this computer can help out alot you don't need to try and guess what that person is feeling.
7679,360430e9b2b6,Evan when some artist are trying to draw a ppersons emotion they don't always know either they would also need the computer .
7680,360430e9b2b6,Dr. Huang says in te story that Da Vinci has and comuter when he draw so that he could get the specific factial expression.
7681,627d56a525ad,If I was to get one of these computes i would like to use it on everyone around me because I love to see people happy and if they are not I would like to make there day.
7682,627d56a525ad,If I am taking a test and I get confused I know that the computers see that and the teacher would know and try to help me out a little.
7683,a9ffc370954c,Using these can help everyone out in so many differen ways.
7684,16666c0dbb61,Eveyone should have one of these or get an computer lie this one.
7685,16666c0dbb61,If you really need to know about smeone you just would look on it to see what it is.
7686,41b5abbc3c7e,This would be good when a school have a play and the people that are watching them need or want to figure out how the characters feel.
7687,c9faafec8062,"Now a days in VAUBAN, Germany people living in these lovely suburbs are living without automobiles."
7688,c9faafec8062,"This area specifically is now known as a car free zone, all except for a main tram that runs from Vauban to downtown Freiburg."
7689,c9faafec8062,"Although there arent any cars running on the streets doesnt mean ownership isnt allowed, you are allowed to own a vehicle, granted you park it in 1 of 2 spots."
7690,c9faafec8062,"Either a 40,000 dollar registered parking garage, or at home in your garage."
7691,c9faafec8062,Vauban is known to have 70 percent of people without cars and 57 percent sold their cars to live in Vauban.

Many days of pollution caused Paris to form a partial driving ban to help maintain air pollution."
7704,06f50a3676a7,Not only that Paris ordered many motorists to leave there cars or be forced to pay a large fine of 22- euros or $31.
7705,06f50a3676a7,"Many did what was said and many did not, if they werent cooperating they would pay the fine and have the vehicle impounded."
7706,06f50a3676a7,"Most of frances pollution came from the favored diesel, they had a tax policy that supported diesel instead of gasoline."

7713,06f50a3676a7,"This has began to influence other countries into believing you dont need a vehicle to get around, it helped them realize a different meaning in transportation."
7714,cd91f604fdec,This banned vehicles and helped reduce smog.
7715,5d540f20d17b,"Though the rain comes down constantly on Bogota it hasnt stopped them from participating in this event, the people of Bogota state ""it helps relieve stress and lower air polution I like it."""
7716,5d540f20d17b,"Cali and Valledupar, two other columbian countries also decreased vehicle use."
7717,5d540f20d17b,Many authorities from seperate countries took a boat or plane to visit Bogota to see the event and were quite enthusiastic.
7718,dfb52f73adda,"Studies in America state due to Obama's goal to lower greenhouse gas emissions is so fortuitous people of america are purchasing less vehicles, driving less and getting fewer licenses."

7722,70a8ff0cd9d4,New Yorks bike sharing policy and a Toll on bridges has greatly decreased driving in it.
7723,126ec8ba17ca,This all shows exact evidence of how the earth is trying to better themselves to get rid of pollution.
7724,126ec8ba17ca,"Not because they are getting rid of cars, but because they are getting rid of cars and keeping people happy"

7726,5ca135166d84,"The ""Evening Star"" or otherwise known as Venus is a very dangerous planet."
7727,290deee90061,"Despite the planet being close to us, we haven't sent any spacecrafts there in the past 30 years."
7728,290deee90061,The reason has alot to do with the fact that a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide covers Venus.
7729,290deee90061,Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venuss atmosphere.
7730,290deee90061,"On the planets surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, which means that its alot of times hotter than the surface of our planet."
7731,290deee90061,The atmospheric pressure is also 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.
7732,290deee90061,These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on Earth.
7733,290deee90061,Also Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system.
7734,5892c135699c,"With all that being said, why would we want to go back there."
7735,19c768b350fb,The reason is because Astronomers think that the Venus was once an earth like planet.
7736,19c768b350fb,"They believe that Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."
7737,19c768b350fb,"Adding more into this is that today, Venus has some features such as mountains and valleys."
7738,086274e9b086,"NASA has come up with an idea on how they would live in

Venus safely and productive."
7739,7afa81033d27,The idea is to allow scientist to float above ground.
7740,7afa81033d27,About 30 miles to be exact.
7741,7afa81033d27,With them hovering 30 miles above ground they should be safe from the ground conditions.
7742,7afa81033d27,"With that, NASA is working on other approaches to study Venus; such as an device that was used in World War 2 that calculates under high pressure of heat and does not require electricity."
7743,8810c8c8cf09,I love the idea of going back to Venus and exploring because we are humans and we have an unlimited imagination.
7744,6e4b18a5f824,"If we want to truly be a civilization, We should be at least a two planet species."

7746,6e4b18a5f824,100 years ago we made the first car.
7747,6e4b18a5f824,Imagine what life wil be like in 100 years.
7748,65fc26269012,"They say the facial expressions for each emotion are universal because even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression, the new emotion are facial movements for example the painted face from the Mona Lisa, we can identify a lot emotions as Vinci's masterpiece."
7749,65fc26269012,Each expression is a neutral face.
7750,65fc26269012,"Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait that conveys happy,worried,sad,etc."
7751,3d7f6561abd1,"imaginate if the computer know when your happy or sad, that well be so cool"
7752,52649deccd9a,then you know if someone is sad and you can help him or you can know if this person is happy and he make you happy two
7753,cd47f7c8370d,the can be great to create new stuff like videogame tv show and all kinda things
7754,f8231e1c0b5e,"most human comunication is nonverbal, including emotionalcomunication, so that mean the computers have to understand that too, sometimes not only moving your facial muscles make make you express your emotion but that maybe make you feel them,making that can reveal sabout the science of the emotions."
7755,2a2a4789aa50,Please come join the Seagoing Cowboys program!
7756,5a29969f7b45,You can tour the world while helping other countries!
7757,85097d14a5b8,"'It is the most adventrous, exciting job you can possibly get,"
7758,ada3fc19c9bf,"I was 18 before arriving in Greece,but I was heading to Greece with 335 horses, and loads of hay and oats to feed the horses with"
7759,0485e5a05b00,"I told them about giving out horses in Greece, and the time I toured other incredible sites like an excavated caslte in Crete."
7760,efd9b5676379,"After being out of breath from persuading them to sign up, I thought that it was worth being out of breath."
7761,efd9b5676379,"Now Don Reist and I have twenty extra helpers for our future trips to spots all over the world, and new friends to tell stories with."
7762,7f01bb11d5c7,Schools are places where kids end up spending the majority of their childhood in.
7763,7f01bb11d5c7,"Most kids end up disliking school for one reason or another, while others might love school."
7764,7f01bb11d5c7,To have the ability to know how a child is feeling and map their patters can become useful in more ways than one.
7765,a4086854e840,The use of reading a students emotions is valuable in many ways
7766,4fc14910397a,helping with possible depression
7767,85f45b245fd0,enhancing the material
7768,ae3aae8e97a4,creating a better enviroment.
7769,fd08c7ebf869,School can be a stressful time for many students and also a time of growth.
7770,fd08c7ebf869,"Especially in high school and even middle school, the childs body is going through puberty."
7771,fd08c7ebf869,This chemical change in the body can lead to mood swings and other issues especially when school stress is added on top.
7772,fd08c7ebf869,"This technology is capable of indicating ""...the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one""(paragraph 7)."
7773,e947c266cdf3,With the aid of this technology the school can help students before they develope mental illnesses like depression that often go unseen due to hiding true emotion.
7774,d466b2ca2efb,"Also, in many schools students usually find the learning material to be sub par or boring in many cases."
7775,d466b2ca2efb,"However with the aid of this technology ""a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" (paragraph 6)."
7776,d466b2ca2efb,If a teacher was able to pin point when exactly a lesson becomes boring it would majorly help with being able to reconstruct it as well
7777,c4ab1af791df,"For difficult classes being able to know when the students are lost would help significantly in increasing the understanding of the material as teachers will be able to know exactly what the students dont understand, and thus be able to help them achieve better grades."
7778,6695c2d175a7,Being able to understand students emotions in a learning enviroment can also help with improving the school overall.
7779,d575e8eaf2b2,"SInce the technology would be able to understand the basic emotions like ""...happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness"" (paragraph 3), this can give a school tons of feedback on how to improve."
7780,d575e8eaf2b2,"For example, with negative emotions, a school would be able to improve its cafeteria food quality from knowing what foods are highly unpopular, and as a result save food from wasting."
7781,d575e8eaf2b2,"Or during school events, even though the event might be a success knowing how each of the students felt about the event would help with improving it for next year."
7782,d575e8eaf2b2,The addition of this technology would allow a school to be the best the possibly could.
7783,c6c3c36b8c63,The addition of this facial technology can be quite revolutionary in a school setting.
7784,c6c3c36b8c63,"As students often dont share their true feelings, issues can be confronted and the students mentality can be improved."
7785,c6c3c36b8c63,"Also a better, and positive learning enviroment can be created."
7786,c6c3c36b8c63,"The ability to remove student confusion and make learning interesting would go a long way in helping not only the students grow and move forward positivly, but also the school as a whole."
7787,e0a0d54aee6d,Venus may have some dangers
7788,9d0db0441b71,The author think's venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.
7789,63985d07bc7f,Here are some things you should know about Venus
7790,9cc00caea054,"Venus may be called "" Evening Star ""."
7791,9cc00caea054,The Evening star is one of the brightest point of light in the sky.
7792,9cc00caea054,Even though Venus is called a Star it's actually a planet.
7793,9cc00caea054,Venus is the secound planet from the sun.
7794,9cc00caea054,It being close to the sun makes it hard to examine closely.
7795,d8d7cd136685,Venus may be very challenging to get around or to beable to find more out about
7796,685ec865fb0f,Venus is the closest to the earth.
7797,685ec865fb0f,Venus is like a cloud-draped world.
7798,685ec865fb0f,One of the dangers of Venus is it being cloud-draped because humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on Venus.
7799,685ec865fb0f,No spacecraft lasted the landing more than a few hour if that.
7800,e68689855e1c,A reason Venus is a dangerous place is the atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide.
7801,9adf081c208a,Venus has challenging clouds that are highly corrosive sulfuric acid.
7802,9adf081c208a,The temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.
7803,9adf081c208a,The atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we feel on our own planet.
7804,9adf081c208a,How we know this informaiton can help understand that the author thinks venus has some dangers on it.
7805,9adf081c208a,"For example , "" These conditions are far more extreme than anything humans encounter on earth ; such an enviroment would crush even a submarine accustomed to diving to the deepest parts of our oceans and would liquefy many metals. """
7806,3a257b6f65dd,Venus would be a worthy pursuit depite the dangers because Venus was once the most Earth-like planet in the solar system.
7807,4d1c8cf4c397,Venus used to be covered with largely oceans and may have supported various forms of life.
7808,4d1c8cf4c397,To this day Venus has some features that are analogous to those on earth.
7809,4d1c8cf4c397,Venus surface is a rocky sediment.
7810,4d1c8cf4c397,"Venus also has some familiar features such as valleys , moutains and craters."
7811,d47dac0905fa,This concludes how the author think's that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.
7812,d47dac0905fa,Venus may be harmful to humans but at one point Venus was just like our home.
7813,d47dac0905fa,Venus once has forms of life like we do today on planet earth.
7814,d47dac0905fa,Venus might be something interesting but the danger's is what keep's us from landing.
7815,9ad96fa7ca65,I am going to tell you the reasons Luke joined the program
7816,c14f78b6bc29,"One is ""he knew it was an opportunity of a lifetime""."
7817,0e7f851fe8d6,"""luke also found time to have fun on board."
7818,ca923486d048,a great opportunity of a lifetime to join the program.
7819,fc323bdc0716,Well my first reason is Luke bomberger had no idea that his life would change soon after his high school graduation.
7820,fc323bdc0716,second is But being a seagoing cowboy was much more than an adventure for Luke Bomberger it opened up the world to him.
7821,fc323bdc0716,"One more reason is that he said""I'm grateful for the opportunity""he says."
7822,fc323bdc0716,Both of thoses reasons suport why he thought it was a great opportunity.
7823,4e9cfd4fa528,he also found time to have fun on board especally on return trips after the animals had been unloaded.
7824,1a27fdb9b374,"One peice of evidence is ""Table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whittling,and games also helped pass the time""."
7825,1a27fdb9b374,"My second peice of evidence is ""Luke also toured an excavated castle in crete and marveled at the panama canal on his way to china."
7826,d92b00af25cb,both of thoses statemeants help me answer question.
7827,d92b00af25cb,Which is why he joined the program.
7828,d92b00af25cb,Both of my reasons were it was great opportunity of a lifetime and Luke was also able to have freetime found time to have fun on board.
7829,a4deffbf9f4a,The face is just a natural landform
7830,b49afbd276cf,nobody lives on Mars it's just a empty planet.
7831,b49afbd276cf,They NASA says that the face on Mars had became a pop icon but i don't think that just because NASA has images that it's ture.
7832,b49afbd276cf,You can't always believe people.
7833,083e1ecae1db,"Although few scientists believed the Face wan an alien artifact, Some People think the Face is bona fide evidenve og life on Mars."
7834,083e1ecae1db,"Evidence that NASA would rathr hide, lets say conspiracy theorists."
7835,083e1ecae1db,"The caption noted that the rock formation resembles a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and a mouth."
7836,083e1ecae1db,This would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars.
7837,52150c6abb12,"Many people thought that is was an alien momument, but on April 5, 1998 Mars Globsl Surveyor flew over Cydonia for the first time."
7838,52150c6abb12,A Man named Micheal Malin and his Mars Oribter Camera team wanted to prove that there were no aliens.
7839,52150c6abb12,Him and his team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos
7840,bde6c3ba2202,People should have been satisfied with knowing that there wasn't an alien monument after all.
7841,6728de44be8d,"Nevertheless, on April 8, 2001 the Mars Global Surveyor drew closer for a second look."
7842,6728de44be8d,They has to rool the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view to get the picture.
7843,6728de44be8d,Malin's team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras mamimum resolution.
7844,6728de44be8d,"In the 2001 image each pixel span 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the 2976 Viking original."
7845,dbeb940a5bec,I think that the researchers shouldn't be having to look seversl times just to prove certain people wrong.
7846,dbeb940a5bec,If they don't believe then they need to go to Mars for themselves.
7847,dbeb940a5bec,It'd great that they got the comparsion but they went through trouble to get there.
7848,dbeb940a5bec,It was not an easy target.
7849,dbeb940a5bec,"In face, it's hard work."
7850,69323ddbbf11,Today many people are using technology for many reasons but there is one piece of technology that has been used a lot more recently.
7851,69323ddbbf11,"The smartphone or mobile phone, many people think that it is not that dangerous but it is as dangerous as most things that can damage or hurt people just not as much."
7852,69323ddbbf11,As it can hurt people in many ways the most severe way is to be in a car accident just by looking at a phone for even a second.
7853,69323ddbbf11,Not only could that person hurt themself but whomever else is in the car or the person they have crashed into.
7854,69323ddbbf11,If it is such a bad way to drive why don't people stop looking at their phones while driving?
7855,075ee118c0cd,Well many people are worried about how their social status is doing and how their friend's day is rather than their safety.
7856,049b7521f4c7,So even if the majority of people were to stop there would always be that other percent who don't care.
7857,049b7521f4c7,Although drivers should not they would still need their phones for GPS.
7858,049b7521f4c7,Many states already have this situation classified as illegal but some states do not.
7859,049b7521f4c7,Even if they were to turn the sound some people may not know where 1/2 miles to turn is.
7860,929b9bda9fa0,"
There are consequences to driving with a person on his or her phone but in some states they should not even if there should be."
7861,69ea7777a173,It should be illegal to drive using their phones.
7862,cc5cb4f00732,People who drive with phones should get a ticket and they should have to pay the fine or they would get jail time.
7863,ba1b6b597904,Many people do not realise just how dangerous not looking at their surroundings are when driving a car.
7864,ba1b6b597904,"People have to worry about cars coming or going or when they have to stop, go or even yield."
7865,cd5ab88179b7,It is known that when drivers get on the road there is a risk of crashing by the car or the person's actions so why make that percentage higher.
7866,1e13deac1b17,Also risk not only themselves but other people.
7867,1e13deac1b17,It is just not right and not fair for other people they could have potentially hurt or damage their possessions.
7868,876dcc453d57,Cell Phones carry A lot of information like the weather or the news and mainly social media.
7869,876dcc453d57,What someone is doing or how they are doing are important to their friends.
7870,876dcc453d57,Many people would agree that these reasons cause them to look at their cell phones
7871,b1d7fc52afc8,"
And would convince other people to stop or text them before they drive to say that they are not going to be responding while they drive."
7872,65cde62e43f8,Many people drive while using their cellular devices and it causes problems for many people.
7873,65cde62e43f8,It is illegal in some states and some in not but even in the illegal states people still do it knowing they could cause damage to someone or themselves or even pay a fine.
7874,65cde62e43f8,It should be illegal anywhere so people can think about whether or not they want to get a ticket.
7875,65cde62e43f8,People should stop to think that they may make someone's day worse.
7876,65cde62e43f8,People should just stop using their phones while driving in general but not everyone chooses to do it.
7877,8710a706575b,The use of tecnology reading your face is a bad idale for some things but not all things.
7878,8710a706575b,Emotions are what humans have.
7879,8710a706575b,"The Facial coding system enables computer to read face exspreshions like happy ,sad,frown,fear,disgust,anger,and suprise"
7880,3bb6376aeff4,The Coding system should not be on every ones computer becuse some people hate adds and the system would just keep showing diffent ones each time.
7881,ad85f78b066f,On the Facial Action Coding System would not be bad if you could shut it off and on other then it being on non stop all day tring to read your face.
7882,c7869b7d9db9,The program would be alsome to look at old pitures to see if they were happy or what not
7883,5e950840d51b,the program makes a 3-D face that has all 44 major muscles in the model .
7884,5e950840d51b,It has to move like a human face dose.
7885,5ba0b9e453df,The Facial Action Coding Systm would be cool if the creater could make it read other creachers like cat or a dog for we could see how they feel
7886,21ee51da5437,cats wag there tail but my cat is happy when he wags his tail what dose that mean than?
7887,21ee51da5437,My dog growls when he vplays what dose it mean?
7888,21ee51da5437,Maby later on they can move on from human faces to other animal faces.
7889,a4f84df0aab5,Dr. Paul Eckter man has alot of good idals with his program.
7890,a4f84df0aab5,He just needs it were the people can turn it on and off othere than being on all the time.
7891,a4f84df0aab5,like how when some people are angry they turn tv on or funny videos.
7892,a4f84df0aab5,That could turnout to becume disaster.
7893,e587123028c5,The Facial Action Coding System is a good idal for school work for if the student would get bord it could change there studing ways up or class room asiments.
7894,a1f454b32a9a,The program could read diffent shown emotions in the program.
7895,a1f454b32a9a,In fact us human perform the same impresive caculation every day.
7896,a1f454b32a9a,"The ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" was neat to see what the program had to say."
7897,a1f454b32a9a,"The Facial Action Coding System read the Mona Lisa painting and it said she was 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted,6 percent fearful,and 2 percent angry."
7898,23ab9bce5a87,The Facial Acting Coding System is a great program and in time it could read how humans feel and animals in the future.
7899,835d67db4a70,I think it will be a great program for computer to have.
7900,835d67db4a70,As long as you can turn them on and off at times.
7901,835d67db4a70,It would be a good way to get rid of adds.
7902,835d67db4a70,Dr. Huang thinks that Da Vinci studied human anatomy to help him paint facial muscles precisly enough to coney specific emotions.
7903,835d67db4a70,The program would help the police with criminals becuse it would read there face and tell them what going on .
7904,eea8df882fe5,Do you think technology can read your emotion
7905,f55f2a3633db,In my opinion I believe technology can't read your emotion
7906,46cadf151f9f,"First of all, emotion has to do with what you're thinking about"
7907,c11e9f3de0c0,a face can lie
7908,0d8136cccef9,and a drawing doesn't always mean it's happy when there is dark around it.
7909,da071a0651cb,"First of all, when you try to see someone's emotion you don't really pay attention to their face you pay attention to how they act and how they talk"
7910,a566f94b116c,Someone can be hyper and talkative some days and the next they can be smiling but not hyper or talking to anybody.
7911,a566f94b116c,Kids come to school and put on a happy face when actually they don't want to be there.
7912,a566f94b116c,It's the same with everything else.
7913,d29bdaee5da5,"Secondly, a face can lie."
7914,d29bdaee5da5,Everyone has something they're thinking about but nobody knows exactly what they're thinking about.
7915,aff2a97c8e42,"Everyone hides their emotion a certain time in life; therefore, you can easily smile but it doesn't mean you're happy."
7916,b606f71a2c3e,"Lastly, in the story the author talks about how they can also use the new technology they made to know the emotion of drawings like Mona Lisa."
7917,f60c4827d4cf,"When you look at the picture of Mona Lisa you see her smiling but the picture has to color and the smile does not look like a real smile, it looks like a fake smile."
7918,f60c4827d4cf,"Also, in the picture of Mona Lisa the background is of a lonely lake or pond which is also without color."
7919,f60c4827d4cf,"Color shows alot of emotion depending on the colors you use, like dark colors determine sadness and bright colors determine happiness but red is in between and usually determines hate; someone being angry."
7920,8bf677170f78,"In conclusion, technology can not read emotions."
7921,8bf677170f78,"Emotion has to do with what is going on in your mind, facial expressions can easily lie, and emotion in drawings determine the colors of the the art."
7922,e6906c095c88,"Imagine this, you've had a long day as a student waking up early and working hard to do well in school all day, but then you remember you have Basketball practice tonight!"
7923,e6906c095c88,"This excites because you have become close friends with your teammates, and it serves as a nice break from everything going on in school."
7924,26b63bebece8,Attending after school clubs and activities can give you a place where people with similar interests and hobbies all come together.
7925,95055f2e26d7,"After school clubs can be a safe space where you and your friends get together to do something you all enjoy, and you could make new friends along the way."
7926,95055f2e26d7,"Being in a club can provide a safe space, and the people there often share your interests."
7927,087e056a0720,Activities like these can make you an all rounded person while also giving you a break from school.
7928,3b852a6f653b,Activities from football to Rubiks cube club can create a safe space for the people on the team or in the club.
7929,d4bad22b7fdb,"What do I mean by ""safe space?"""
7930,d4bad22b7fdb,"A safe space is where people can share how they feel, and why they feel that way."
7931,d4bad22b7fdb,An example could be if you're on a football team your teammates become your friends and that gives you a whole community of people who care about you.
7932,d4bad22b7fdb,"It doesn't even have to be a team it could even be a group that likes horses, but they still have something in common to bond over."
7933,d4bad22b7fdb,"Teammates also tend to build you up, and give a boost in confidence which can help you be a stronger person."
7934,d4bad22b7fdb,Did you know that having fun with your friends and participating in the activities you enjoy can even help you get into college?
7935,10735f34cfc6,"I think that having students participate in an extracurricular activities could very beneficial for many different aspects of their development, such as social, emotional, and in some cases even physical."
7936,7130cf7e8433,Most students are very focused on their academics and doing well to look good for college.
7937,7130cf7e8433,"What they might not know is colleges don't only look at grades they also look at your extracurricular s. Looking at what you did after school as well as in school helps hem see that you are able to juggle both things at once, but what they don't know is we actually enjoy it!"
7938,7130cf7e8433,"Though it might seem like a lot especially with all of our school work, it could serve as the well deserved break we need."
7939,54270525879d,"Students have a lot on their plates between school, homework, and studying, sometimes it's good to take a break"
7940,6bb5351e8b55,What better way to relax then do something you enjoy with other people that enjoy it as well.
7941,6bb5351e8b55,Playing a sport after school can help you create close friends and teammates.
7942,6bb5351e8b55,When you think about stress reliving one of things you might think of is one of your favorite things to do with some of your friends.
7943,6bb5351e8b55,"Well guess what, you just explained what a club is."
7944,6bb5351e8b55,In that portion of your day you don't have to worry about acing that test all you have to think about is swishing that three or winning that chess match.
7945,16612819f598,As a whole I think that after school activities could be beneficial to students in many ways.
7946,16612819f598,"Many students might not fit in to friend groups, but with after school clubs they know they have similarities with their peers."
7947,16612819f598,It's a great way to relive stress with the people you care about while doing something you care about
7948,d5bbcf6d549f,"That's why I think that having everyone participate in a club or sport could be very beneficial for these reasons, and I think it's a great addition to our school systems."
7949,257d02eb4ef8,"Did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of green house gas  emission in europe and up to 50 percent in some intensive areas in the united states .there were 5,500 residents within a rectangular square mile in the unitedstates,the enviorment  protection  agency is promiting ""car reduce""."
7950,257d02eb4ef8,communities and legislators are starting to act if cauiously in previous years80 percent of approiations have by law gone to high ways and only 20 percent to other transport.
7951,7164afee185a,many thing consists of having a caer if you dont have a car you can hardly get around
7952,c5dd6fe46767,it would be very diffucult to do the thing you want to do!
7953,7641a02ac715,"many people have cars for many reasons they have cars to get them around ,to and from work, and alot of other reasons .without a car many things will be very hard to accomplish."
7954,7641a02ac715,"alot of things come with having a car you have to make sure its running right ,make sure all the tires are good , fix it if it need fixing ,and tend to it when it needs to be fix."
7955,7641a02ac715,cars come from many places all over the world thers car part that come from all over the world you just got t know your carb and when there is a problem!
7956,7641a02ac715,in this enviorment some people say cars are bad because of the gas that be in the air and that gas is expensive but without a car nothing is possible well i wouldnt say possible but it would be very hard to get around .now a days you need a car just to go around the coner and back!
7957,9add198e1383,"Ding, ding, ding."
7958,9add198e1383,Thats the sound of a school bell at the end of the day.
7959,9add198e1383,"Over 500 kids rushing to their bus, but not one of them is staying after school."
7960,9add198e1383,It's not that schools don't have after school it's that students just don't care or they don't know what's out there.
7961,9add198e1383,"In all my years of going to school I have all ways participated in after school activities, and every single one of them has helped me in some way, and that's why I think that students should participate in them"
7962,d65bb7845a52,"Students should be required to participate in sports, working on year book, or serving on student council"
7963,0fe754368a9c,it helps them maintain grades
7964,f17567874bde,"gives students a chance to interact with other students,"
7965,1f4e4d5db365,they have a chance to give back to their school.
7966,d5cc53c0a864,Students that play sports have to maintain their grades when they'er off the field in order to play on the field.
7967,0fed599419be,"This helps them to have a ""C"" or higher and they can apply what they learn on the field to when they'er off the field."
7968,0fed599419be,A student in my class is always asking for his absent work because he has to leave early for one of his games.
7969,0fed599419be,This student doesn't play just one sport but 3.
7970,0fed599419be,So when he comes back the next day he has to make up all of his work if he wants to stay on the team.
7971,0fed599419be,An example of applying what student learn on the field to off the field is my friend that plays football.
7972,0fed599419be,"He said to me ""I could never make a touch down if some one wasn't covering my blind side"",then he said, ""It's not about if

I win because

I would have never maid it if there was no one on the team to cover me."""
7973,0fed599419be,Then the next day at his game he maid sure that the crowds were celebrating him and the team when they won.
7974,ea9802ea1381,"Year book gives students a chance to interact with other students by giving new students a chance to make friends, and it helps them find other students they can relate to."
7975,dc1321fe246f,"In the 6th grade I was going to a new school, that I new nothing about and then club sign ups came, and I decided to sign up for year book."
7976,dc1321fe246f,when I started out they gave me a camera and told me what kind of pictures they were looking for.
7977,dc1321fe246f,When I went around the school and asked students if I could take their picture they were nice about it and said sure.
7978,dc1321fe246f,"Out of the 25 people I asked to take their picture 17 of them asked me if I wanted to be friends, and I said yes."
7979,dc1321fe246f,Also the people in the year book club were new to the school just like me we talked about how we came to a new school and none of are friends came with us.
7980,dc1321fe246f,Year book helped me find friends and find people who understood what I was going trough.
7981,9c7150f679ff,"Student council is a good way to give back to your school, by showing that they appreciate your school and to show school spirit"
7982,e24bb52fa360,Students on student council show that they appreciate their school when they represent them.
7983,e24bb52fa360,"For example when student council does a sock drive and then goes and distributes the socks to the less fortunate, they are showing how their school feels, and that they want to give back to the community we live in."
7984,e24bb52fa360,"When the students on student council show school spirit they go to the school sports games, show up for fund raisers, and set an example for how other students should act in school."
7985,e24bb52fa360,By showing this appreciation and spirit they set the bar higher for other schools and show that they support our's.
7986,a2e2c5f94f72,"Students should participate in sports, working on year book, or serving on student council because they will have good grades, a chance to interact with other students, and a way to give back to the community."
7987,a2e2c5f94f72,Students will build character buy interacting with other students and have fun while doing it.
7988,a2e2c5f94f72,"Ding, ding, ding, thats the sound of the bell for after school."
7989,a2e2c5f94f72,"All the students flood into the hallways talking to each other about sports, year book, and student council."
7990,a2e2c5f94f72,No student fells left out and every student has a friend.
7991,531aecb5b192,Venus and Earth are very similiar
7992,833a81b166b8,somtimes Venus is just right around the corner from Earth.
7993,dc241e317f6b,"The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" supports the idea of studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because he provides sufficient evidence."
7994,f9321105e55a,Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because of the similarities with Earth.
7995,21eeb6c36be0,"The Author explains that ""Today, Venus still some features that are analogous to those on Earth"" (4)."
7996,21eeb6c36be0,Analogous means the outside has changed but the inside or function are similiar to that pf something else.
7997,21eeb6c36be0,If Venus still has valleys and mountains similiar to the of Earth then if we studied those features we could find out what happened to Venus decades ago.
7998,91185976db83,"The Author also states, ""Venus can somtimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit"" (4)."
7999,ed7b1b75942c,"Launching space crafts to other planets is very expensive and even more so for a planet light year away, but if we can send space crafts to Venus when it is closest to us then it will Americans hundreds in tax dollars and we will learn a great deal from Venus."
8000,b18c6bf86356,"In conclusion, Venus is worthy to be explored because there is so much we do not know about it yet and we could find something on that planet that we mever thought exsisted before."
8001,37c05a8013e7,What makes this a valueable tool to students?
8002,37c05a8013e7,Can this tool be used on cell phones?
8003,37c05a8013e7,Can we make this tool worldwide for all schools?
8004,37c05a8013e7,what will the outcome of students emotional expressions if this tool is valuable?
8005,d21f9961334a,What makes this a valuable tool to students?
8006,d21f9961334a,This would actually be wonderful tool in schools everywhere.
8007,d21f9961334a,A student can use this tool for many differnt reason in school.
8008,d21f9961334a,"A student could have really big exam, test etc."
8009,d21f9961334a,the student may believe their ready.
8010,f7aff5d0fb3f,this would system would detect if the student is really ready or not.
8011,efe644d2f83e,"Instead of going to computer lad, waiting on your teacher."
8012,efe644d2f83e,A good way to keep this system in route.
8013,efe644d2f83e,It should be an app on your celluar device to use this tool.
8014,efe644d2f83e,"with this being on your cell phone,it makes it easier way for a stuidents that has a friend thats always in differnt moods."
8015,02d4bf6bc9ec,With this tool we can detect that friends mood.
8016,6d969c5b3516,"
What will it take for this tool to make it worldwide?"
8017,6d969c5b3516,It will half to have many great response
8018,d3d5212bcacf,This tool should be used many other places than schools.
8019,5ebb40ee24a3,"It will be awesom for police officers, doctors etc."
8020,5ebb40ee24a3,Once one school has great feedback.
8021,5ebb40ee24a3,It make other school try it out.
8022,3bcc110bd0f2,The outcome of this system is wonderful.
8023,3bcc110bd0f2,I done used this system over a millions times at school.
8024,3bcc110bd0f2,It has actually worked great at othere school to.
8025,86230f5ad698,Now we have a great way of dectecting someone else emotions.
8026,719a506233a6,Do you guys think that venus is dangers?
8027,719a506233a6,Well for our part venus need to get up close and personal despite the risk or maybe they should think of them as challenges.
8028,e4973642843c,Astronmers are fascinated by venus because it may once have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system.
8029,82866344115d,Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere.
8030,6a51eaa96fba,"Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it had proved a very challenging place to examine more closely."
8031,23b51e0e40d7,Venus would need to get uo close and personal despite the risk and maybe should think of them as challenges.
8032,dd0d27a561a5,Astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in the solar system because people from long time had to covered the oceans to support carious forms of life to them just how earth is from us today.
8033,f1a5f47981d3,Also because the value of the returning of the venus seem to be a little difficult but there was other option to make a mission to be safe and productive to both of them for the astronomers to be by venus and know the planets in the solar system.
8034,81860bef0c8d,Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosvie sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere because they think that the challenging for venus might not be working for them but now they do work because the conditions are now more extreme then any human encounter out there and all of the environment can crush of a submarine
8035,4c39bd95588c,But then venus has the hottest surface temperature to any of the planet in the solar system that their is even when mercury is close to the sun venus can still be hot for the system being beside another planet.
8036,9ecb1e45c92c,"Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely."
8037,d095b55d89ad,Venus can be the closest planet to earth even in terms of size and density.
8038,d095b55d89ad,Also each of the previous mission can have an unmanned and for a reason no sacecraft has been survived for the time of landing for more than hours or even minutes.
8039,d095b55d89ad,"Venus had more than three decades, but venus reputation for a challenge planet is for humans to work on and study for and to despite the proximity to it."
8040,7aa81f9b21db,"This is what I think the author suggests to the study of venus because venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk and maybe should think of them for a challenge, because astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may once have been the most earth-like planet in the solar system, even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in venus's atmosphere, and venus is simple to see from the distant but can be safe vantage point in earth and has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely to it."
8041,312f08ce7706,"Life is a marathon not a sprint; therefore, people can not take breaks from educating themselves, even in the summer."
8042,312f08ce7706,"However, long, boring, and useless summer project persuade students to avoid the project; forcing life's marathon to become a sprint."
8043,3f07549b2101,"Summer projects need a change and can be by students,"
8044,940a150ebd30,"students know how long to make it,"
8045,a0109d10d202,"how to make it interesting,"
8046,bc8a4a8ca9c7,what it must include.
8047,9d120b1e3675,"Summer gives students a break from the long and hard work of the strenuous school year, therefore the stack of an eight page summer packet that may not be difficult, is enough to intimidate a student to cheat on it or simply not finish it."
8048,9d120b1e3675,Student-summer-packet-designers understand the struggle and can make it a length at persuades the students to complete it on their own.
8049,e72547190316,Others might suggest that having fewer questions and less pages will just decrease a student's time spent learning or reviewing material.
8050,b0ccfc839a47,"However, the decrease in the amount of problems and page length will only urge students to complete the packet instead of copying."
8051,e10c327c24ae,"Summer is meant for students to take a break from the boring and uninteresting work of the school year, therefore, the dull material in a summer packet only validates their choice to start and finish the packet a day before the start of the new school year, if at all."
8052,e10c327c24ae,If student-summer-packet-designers take control over the content of these packets other students will find the information more alluring.
8053,a7fd3fc1f2d9,Some can argue that teachers can pick just as fascinating topics as students.
8054,96d5db734c1e,"However, because of age gaps and other variables many teacher do not know what students find entertaining."
8055,629d140b6f76,Many items in the packet also lack the ability to teach valuable information that can lead to the success in the course.
8056,629d140b6f76,Student-summer-packet-designers can use their knowledge from taking the course to make a packet filled with example that they would have benefited from and with problems they struggled with; allowing the new students to be better prepared.
8057,edb5292a1e5b,People might suggest that teachers know the material the best so they will form the best summer packet.
8058,9d65701bb3c1,"However, students know what they struggled with more than the teachers; therefore, they know what to put in the packet to avoid struggle for future students."
8059,c1b2eeb74788,Students should undoubtedly make the summer packet for upcoming students.
8060,c1b2eeb74788,"In the past, teachers have made a long, boring, and useless summer projects."
8061,c1b2eeb74788,"In the future, students should find that their summer projects aren't a disservice."
8062,c1b2eeb74788,Teachers can now give students the opportunity to create summer projects that keep students engaged in learning over there rejuvenating break.
8063,696533ab92ce,Sometimes having to be a scientist is not the best idea.
8064,696533ab92ce,"Scientist discover different things at different paces,such as the ones that these scientists discovered on Mars."
8065,e7dc60239aa3,This face that the scientists discovered have evidence that it is just a natural landform
8066,02fe3eee5a40,It could also be proven that the face that was found on Mars was not created by aliens.
8067,9744e13247b0,"First off,the face that was found has no signs of being an alien because any planet has those wierd funky looking holes right?"
8068,3bfe6059b644,It could have been that with the temperature and time those holes could have appeared making it look like a human face.
8069,3bfe6059b644,It could of just simply have been a coincidence that it happened like that.
8070,3bfe6059b644,"Either way we could say that maybe it was an alien or just a natural landform,nobody has been able to personally prove it because there has not been one astronaut that has went up to Mars and looked at it with its own eyes."
8071,3bfe6059b644,The human being has made assumptions about a lot of different things and the majority of the time the human being is incorrect because they do not have evidence to prove that what they said was correct.
8072,2523bba9314b,"Next,lets say that maybe the human being is correct,how could scientists prove that it is what the human being suspects?"
8073,218ac77d3d85,"In the article in paragraph 2 it reads,""Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa,common enough around Cydonia,only this one had usually shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharoh."""
8074,218ac77d3d85,"In this part of the reading the author of this article are saying that it could have just been another Martian mesa,but that this one had the unusual shadows that make it look like an Egyptian Pharoh."
8075,218ac77d3d85,Like it says in the text it could have just been the shadows something that make it look like an ancient Egyptian Pharoh.
8076,218ac77d3d85,It could have maybe been that Martian that the scientists have said it is.
8077,342bf43c44f8,"Finally,in this situation scientists might be correct again."
8078,342bf43c44f8,It could only be a natural landform that formed with the weather or something different that helps little things like these form up.
8079,74becce7879c,"There are no certain clues or evidence that this ""face"" could be a human or an ancient Egyptian Pharoh."
8080,74becce7879c,Sometimes the human being wants to suspect things that are not close or correct to what a specialized scientist can do.
8081,74becce7879c,Sometimes it is just probably that the human brain gets carried away by what it looks at.
8082,74becce7879c,"Sometimes it helps to pay close attention to what we are doing or looking at, for the hiumans good."
8083,0a0fad823542,This new technology is very useful to find peoples emotions or even to what they're thinking about
8084,ad85660c4068,But also it can be very bad to read other peoples emotions because it can become very personal.
8085,399d2e34875c,"I say this because what if a kid is having a bad day in the class room and you read their emotions or even thoughts, it can be very rude."
8086,399d2e34875c,An example would be what if some kid was aving some hard times at home before they went to school and they're thinking about what happened the night before they went to school or what will happen to them when they go home from school.
8087,4fbe91d51a03,But this new technology can be very helpful because what if that student is struggling in their classes and they're too shy to say anything or to get any help.
8088,68ba016ed8c7,It can be very stressful and may lead to the student to want to just shut down and shut anyone out.
8089,68ba016ed8c7,"But if you had this tachnology in the classroom it can help the student, becausse then the teacher will know that there is something wrong and try to help the student out with his or her problems in a different way like in tuduring only that select student."
8090,68ba016ed8c7,Or the teacher could go up to the student and figure out what's wrong and persude the student to be more open and talk about what all is wrong.
8091,b7e76afc821b,But like I had said it can be very helpful or very harmful in ways.
8092,6c12f2c8d172,I think this facial action codig system would be really helpfull to people who work on computers or students
8093,e0f9f78d30a6,comptuer work is boring and lame so i would want it to send me somethjing that makes me laugh or smile.
8094,47890609db4c,I think the facial acting coding system will be a good idea on life on this plane.
8095,47890609db4c,t it could help out our students
8096,9e84a639f366,like it said in paragraph 6 it said the computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.
8097,9e84a639f366,Then the computer could modify the lesson like an effective human instuctor.
8098,9e84a639f366,or when you get on anybody it could see your emotion and give you something that woukld help with it.
8099,9e84a639f366,"it could make video games better and in paragraph 6 it says that

""most human communication is nonverbal including emotional communication so computers need to understand that to""."
8100,ac7a23e82711,Then again some people would think that its weird to have a computer watching your face 24/7
8101,7d3cf21840d6,aybe it could turn into a robot and take over the world.
8102,5cc7ce9e02b7,but if they did come out with the facial action coding system it would be kinda cool
8103,7993293a3b7e,to have videos and stuff to cheer you up if your sad if your in a good mood could send you something to make you laugh.
8104,7993293a3b7e,Even if your just doing homework and it could tell that your upset or confused or just bugged out by the problem it could help you without even asking fo9r help it would help you out right away i think thats coool cause alot of kids need help on stuff like that and for teachers they cant help alot of students with work.
8105,7993293a3b7e,So before the teacher even gets to them the computer could be helping them alreadfy its like a teaher thats already there and lord knows every student wants that extra help to pass.
8106,ca3f08b3ae35,"Yes, I think technology is good for everyone because your computor can tell when you are bored, happy, and sad"
8107,20601e614a47,I feel like it would be an great idea to create something like this because if you are bored your computor may have something different for you to do instead of sitting there bored about the work you are doing.
8108,20601e614a47,Also if you are sad and not feeling likr your normal self the computor can cheer you up by doing something to make you feel better.
8109,20601e614a47,What if you have an computor and it can tell you having mixed emotions and the computor help you with that?
8110,20601e614a47,I really think if we have this technology today everything would be much better.
8111,20601e614a47,I say everything would be much better because kids today get bored fast and we need something that would help them not to get bored fast.
8112,20601e614a47,"We really should have an computor that can tell if we'er happy, sad, and even mad because what if it help us out of them type of emotions?"
8113,20601e614a47,What if we'er sad and the computor help us through the day?
8114,20601e614a47,What if we'er bored and the computor make he work be fun?
8115,2a6a59e8f135,I really wish we had this type of technologhy in our generation today.
8116,6b089812d866,"Venus, Venus is known as Earths twin because of having similarity's."
8117,6b089812d866,"NASA hasn't yet found a way to have a rocketship to last on the palnet, so let alone a person could last up there."
8118,6b089812d866,The longest a rocket has lasted on the planet was three weeks.
8119,6b089812d866,NASA is still working on a way to send a rocket and people onto Venus wothout failing.
8120,f4c10234006b,Venus is supposed to be the Earth's twin.
8121,35e35d4e57ce,"Venus has the closest density, size and occasionally the cloest planet in distance too."
8122,35e35d4e57ce,This planet is the second planext from the Earth.
8123,35e35d4e57ce,"All the planets orbit the sun at different speeds, and sometimes Eath is closer to Mars and other times it is closer to Venus."
8124,35e35d4e57ce,"Venus is called the ""Evening star"""
8125,3bb24db1b05d,"At the begining no space craft had survived on Venus for hours, but one of the space crafts have lasted for three weeks"
8126,6346c223b898,They may call Venus Earth's twin but it isnt a livable place.
8127,6346c223b898,The pressuure of the planet is 90 times grater than Earth's.
8128,6346c223b898,Venus has a very thick atmospere of 97% carbon dixide.
8129,6346c223b898,The conditions are far to extreme to humans.
8130,6346c223b898,"The enviorment would be able to crush even a submarine that can take a lot of water pressure at the deepest point, Venus would liquefy the metal."
8131,fc97c394fc0a,Venus has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in the solar system.
8132,40e450765e6c,Even thought Mercury is the closest planet to the sun Venus is still hottest within heat and pressure.
8133,40e450765e6c,The temeture is 170 degrees Fahrenheit.
8134,40e450765e6c,The air pressure is also almost sea level on Earth.
8135,40e450765e6c,"The enviorment is very rocky, it has many valleys, mountains ans crates."
8136,40e450765e6c,"It has erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and freguent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."
8137,40e450765e6c,They say Venus used to be covered in Oceans.
8138,e0d2e813cef5,NASA is doing hundreds of projects to get a space craft to land on Venus and to explore Venus.
8139,d649a40c9abb,NASA is experimenting with mechanical computers which were first envisioned in the 1800's and played an important role in the 1940's during World War II.
8140,d649a40c9abb,Its very shocking that modern computers can't last up on Venus.
8141,d649a40c9abb,Modent computers do not have the gears and leavels that the mechanical computer has.
8142,d649a40c9abb,That computer is much more controlable and is not more lyable to have problems.
8143,b6757673b734,"All together Venus is not a livable planet, yet and probally will not be one for a while."
8144,b6757673b734,A human can live on Venus but it will be very hard to live on.
8145,b6757673b734,As i said before it has 97% of Carbon dioxide and is more likely gonna be very hard to breath.
8146,b6757673b734,Venus is very very hot at 170 degrees fahrenheit.
8147,b6757673b734,The air pressure is really close to sea leavels on Earth imagine how hard it is to breath there.
8148,b6757673b734,"The planet is very rocky and has many valleys, moutains and caters."
8149,b6757673b734,"Let's not forget that you may wake up to erupting volcanos, powerful eathquakes, and freguent lightning stikes to probes seeking to land its surface."
8150,b6757673b734,That all happens on the planet Venus.
8151,b6757673b734,Would you want to live there?
8152,c6045fa925b3,What is Venus and how can we konw what it is?
8153,c6045fa925b3,"A Venus is sometime called the ""Evening Star"" and it is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky."
8154,3692d9fc3f06,"The studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because of how it said in page 2 ""the Earth, Venus, Mars, our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds."""
8155,46419c0a7101,The plant Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size.
8156,46419c0a7101,In space terms humans is ometimes right around the corner in space ters humans have sent numerus spaceraft to land on this cloud draped world
8157,aa4fef2cfe8c,"In Venus there are thing that we need because in page 3 it said "" On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit."""
8158,d98571acc4fe,Why are we trying to go to Venus?
8159,d98571acc4fe,We are trying to go to Venus there are thing that need to have
8160,a06d3d528070,"In page 5 it said "" Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling Venusian landscape."""
8161,a06d3d528070,It's trying to said it that how can we go there and can we live in that plane.
8162,a06d3d528070,"Solar power would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth."
8163,0d3ea54a2a40,The time have come that we need to see what is out there and see if we can make it happen and try to make a different for everybody.
8164,ff0b1515a589,"One of the brightest points of light in the night sky is the ""Evening Star' which is also a close planet to us called Venus."
8165,ff0b1515a589,Venus might seem harmless and pretty from a distance but when you get close it can be really dangerous.
8166,ff0b1515a589,The conditions of Venus are hazardous to us.
8167,ff0b1515a589,In fact we have had past missions that were never recorded becuase not a single mission succeded.
8168,ff0b1515a589,"However, NASA is trying to come up with technology that can survive these conditions so we can study Venus."
8169,b8f800a1d646,"The closest planet to Earth in density, size, and sometimes distance also is, in fact, Venus."
8170,b8f800a1d646,It was even once may have been known as the most Earth-like planet in our solar system.
8171,b8f800a1d646,"Venus and Earth has come similar features such as rocky sediment, valleys, mountains, and craters."
8172,b8f800a1d646,"However, Venus isn't all that pretty."
8173,e40b798a0dcf,There are some really big dangers when coming in contact with this planet.
8174,02a81c4dd4fb,Venus has almost a 97 percent carbon dioxide blanket that covers the planet.
8175,02a81c4dd4fb,The fluffy clouds are really just sulfuric acid in the atmosphere on Venus.
8176,02a81c4dd4fb,The temperature on Venus is an average of 800 degrees Farenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience here on Earth.
8177,02a81c4dd4fb,Because of these harsh conditions the several missions to Venus were remain unknown because no spacecraft was able to survuve the landing for more than a few hours leading to us not being able to collect samples of the materials on Venus's surface.
8178,496377c7defc,"Despite the harsh conditions and the unsuccessful missions, we could still be able to study Venus"
8179,6d95e9f647a3,A possible solution to the conditions is to have the scientists float above the surface on the planet.
8180,6d95e9f647a3,"Another way, is to have a vehicle instead of a person hover over the surface."
8181,6d95e9f647a3,NASA is working on new approaches to study Venus.
8182,6d95e9f647a3,They make devices such as electronics made of silicon carbide and test it in a chamber that resembles the same conditions as Venus.
8183,6d95e9f647a3,"When comparing systems that use mechanical parts than modern electronics, the mechanical parts an be made to where they are more resistant to the forces on Venus such as pressure and heat."
8184,b66b57f27bd1,"Instead of looking at all the flaws in studying Venus, there are still some major components that can lead us to studying it"
8185,72a51cd28fcc,"Even though Venus has harsh conditions that humans are not able to survive on, there are still technological avdvances that could lead us to exploring or living on the planet."
8186,72a51cd28fcc,"Most scientists are curious of new things even if they can not physically study it in which the, ""Human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."""
8187,72a51cd28fcc,such as Venus.
8188,72a51cd28fcc,The conditions of Venus will not stop scientists or researchers from trying to gather more and more information of Venus.
8189,72a51cd28fcc,The study of Venus could be an oppertunity to a whole new world.
8190,72a51cd28fcc,There are ways and technological ways that will allow humans to live on Venus but it just has not been discovered yet.
8191,e7535c075ae0,Venus is a harmful planet with dangerous conditions.
8192,e7535c075ae0,"However, with developing technology we figure out ways to study the planet"
8193,13a065edcdd0,Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because one day our population could be living on it
8194,2fa08ca28b72,"Even though there are dangers, there is no way in studying more about Venus if we never try to come up with ways to safely research it."
8195,2fa08ca28b72,Venus could be our next planet.
8196,2fa08ca28b72,To find out if it is then more research and risks will need to come into affect.

8219,103642391d49,in the artical the autoer shows how they would like to see venus get explored dispite the harsh condisons and odd wether
8220,91ff4de85cc5,the autoer gives many resons why they would like to see venus such as how it is earths twin
8221,e86124e006ab,flying over it with a blimp or jet of some kind
8222,a2aa289c212b,as well as a mecanical computer.
8223,2ec94add1a53,the authoer states that venus is eraths twin
8224,f128289a123f,this would a huge milestone and would be amazing.
8225,f128289a123f,one of many resons would be to use it for the study of earth and our sun.
8226,5237f80f2f8a,the next way would be a bilmp or jet of some kind that would fly over venus at an altutude that is safe for use.
8227,dc3f884db3d3,this is however a bad way to get there for the astronuts would be there for a short time becuse of fuel cost and coservaton.
8228,dc3f884db3d3,as well as there would be no real way to test the surfuse of venus from there ass you could not get to the surfuce.
8229,7d7f60625902,the last way to get there is by sneding a mecalical computer
8230,5642898e63cc,this would give use amazing resalts.
8231,5642898e63cc,but a the cost of developing a computer that the last time these were largly used was in the 1940's wolud be a fotune and they left that out for they relly whant to go.
8232,e623375b37ae,"the from the artical how the auther relliy wants to go to venus so they gave us the resons how it is earths twin, flying over it with a blimp or jet of some kind, as well as a mecanical computer."
8233,e623375b37ae,so in conclusen the auther relly whant to go to venus
8234,b36658b0b3df,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author provides a compelling and efficient argument to support the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers."
8235,b36658b0b3df,"Using statistics, factual information, and specific plans being developed as we speak, the author convinces the audience that exploring Venus is worth the risks involved."
8236,d31a62e06861,"The author throroughly describes the immersive learning possibilities that could be discovered by studying the foreign planet, the surviveable and safe travel conditions for humans, and other exploration options to ensure a safe and efficient venture to Venus."
8237,7e9d5ca13124,"First of all, the author immediately combats the argument of Venus being too dangerous to venture."
8238,a68ca3fe3bf3,"When discussing the exploration of Venus, most people are turned off by its reputation as a dangerous and challenging planet for humans to study."
8239,a68ca3fe3bf3,"While the author doesn't stray away from these harsh extremities, they make sure to prove how these details seem insignificant and how safe travel can still be executed."
8240,a68ca3fe3bf3,The author thoroughly describes the plan provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to allow astronauts to float above the fray and avoid the hazardous conditions.
8241,a68ca3fe3bf3,"They provide specific qualities of the plan, such as the air pressure being close to the sea level on Earth, the abundance of solar power, and the containment of radiation, to prove how humans would be kept in a safe atmosphere."
8242,a68ca3fe3bf3,They even provide a real world connection between NASA's possible solution and a blimp-like vheicle hovering around the ground to make it easier for the audience to understand.
8243,a68ca3fe3bf3,The author combats the speculaiton of Venus being too dangerous to explore in order to further support the idea of it being a worthy pursuit.
8244,9c39ce72acdb,"Furthermore, the author heavily emphasizes the learning opportunities that exploring the foreign planet would undoubtedly provide us."
8245,2bbf2426c702,"While providing simple, yet interesting facts about Venus, such as it being the planet closest to Earth's density and size, may be enough to intrigue the audience into wanting to learn more about the planet, the author takes it a step further."
8246,2bbf2426c702,The author goes in depth about the possibility of Venus being the most Earth-like planet in our solar system long ago.
8247,2bbf2426c702,"They detail the planet's environment today, consisting of Earth-like structures such as rocky sediment surfaces, valleys, mountans, craters, and other geological findings."
8248,2bbf2426c702,"They also state ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."""
8249,2bbf2426c702,"This information opens up an entirely new realm of possibilites for the audience to consider, and is more likely to interest them as it directly relates to our life on Earth."
8250,2bbf2426c702,"The way the author has set up the comparisons of Earth and Venus have allowed the audience to view the exploration of the planet as an opportunity to see a planet that could be like us; a planet with living, breathing forms of life similar to what we see everyday."
8251,2bbf2426c702,"The author uses this information to encourage the audience to view the pursuit of Venus as a chance to gain information on the things we see in our everyday life, and not just complex ideas that are difficult to understand and most-likely won't affect them."
8252,7cacbcfb82be,"Finally, the author provides numerous options being developed for humans to embark in safe and efficient travel to Venus."
8253,904e1bcf2cc3,"When discussing the potential plans to explore the planet, the author states ""Many researches are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."""
8254,904e1bcf2cc3,"This quote makes it clear to the audience that scientists are doing whatever it takes to develop multiple, efficient plans for space travel."
8255,904e1bcf2cc3,The author also goes onto provide different examples to further convey how close scientists are to developing the safest plan possible.
8256,904e1bcf2cc3,"They specifically mention the use of simplified electronics made of silicon carbide and explain how they've already been tested in a chamber that simulate the conditions of Venus's surfaces, yet how they're still being improved upon."
8257,904e1bcf2cc3,"They also describe an old technology called mechanical computer, noting how this technology has already been used frequently in the 1940's and how it can be incorporated into space travel now."
8258,904e1bcf2cc3,The author has given detailed descriptions of the efforts made and the options available to provide a safe embarkment for humans to support the ideas that Venus is a worthy pursit.
8259,407d4d7a304a,"Clearly, the author has efficiently and convincingly supported the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."
8260,407d4d7a304a,"By describing all the information about the existence of other life forms and the similarities to Earth that we could potentially learn from the study, the author proves how worthy Venus is to be discovered."
8261,407d4d7a304a,"The author also rebuttals one of the main concerns for traveling to the planet by explaining how plans are being developed to make travel and living conditions surviveable, safe, and efficient for both humans and machines."
8262,407d4d7a304a,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author was able to convey and support the idea that Venus is worthy of exploration."
8263,dc4936042b3f,"My claim for, ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" would go against what the author is trying to say."
8264,d7ed71d7ffaf,"The reason is, because anybody can say that they made a Facial Action Coding System computers."
8265,86c348000711,Also the Author says that the Facial Action Coding System computers can Deteced when you are happy or when you are sad.
8266,86c348000711,In Paragraph 4 it says that each expression is compared against a neutral face showing no emotion.
8267,86c348000711,Also it says that it can scan movements in a real face or in the the painted face of Mona Lisa.
8268,86c348000711,Plus it can be used for a video as well that show a new emotion with the software.
8269,f59faeef1c55,If somebody did make a computer like that then why did nobody put it in a Newspaper or even a magazine
8270,af083f1c57fb,If you are reading this then you would understand what I am trying to say or try to tell you.
8271,af083f1c57fb,I think also if they did come put with the computer then people would like to be able to hear what the computer is capable of.
8272,af083f1c57fb,If you understand then you would agree with me that the people should know what it does and what it can not do.
8273,af083f1c57fb,"If it can stop fight's then it should be brought to the people's attention, but if it can not stop fight's then it should not be brought to the people's attention"
8274,a02c1db5d864,What if you the reader are using this and it tells you that you are mad then keep it.
8275,a02c1db5d864,"Then on the other hand you got to realize that if it says that you are mad but you are happy, then give it back to the company that you bought the item from and get your money back."
8276,a02c1db5d864,So that is why my claim is going to be against what the author is trying to say.
8277,6bb68e710705,The reason why that is my claim is because you can never trust if the item will work or not.
8278,f37ceabbeb0b,If a real person is reading this then you will understand what I am trying to tell you.
8279,f37ceabbeb0b,"Also if you were wise as well then you can understand what I am trying say by, ""you can never trust if the item will work or not."""
8280,ae0e595e7567,So this is why my claim is what it is.
8281,8e80cd25b6d5,"I think that the new technology to read students faces in the class room could be of some use, but I also think that it would not be of use in the classroom."
8282,09e05c3c073f,The reason I think it would be useful is it could help a teacher understand some of the kids facial expressions.
8283,f19a4878cd6f,"A teacher can read the childs face to see if they can help then when they are sad and dont tell anyone, but I also think that it would be an invasion of the childs space, because sometimes when kids or even adults get mad or sad and they dont say anything to anyone it's because they dont want people to know."
8284,f19a4878cd6f,It could help in somecases like when a child is being bulllied at school and they dont tell someone then the teacher could use the device to see that the child is either sad or mad or even both.
8285,5548ca6d015f,"
I support and do not support this at ther same time."
8286,5548ca6d015f,"i support it because I feel it could be helpful but I do not suppot this because I feel if a child needs help with how they are feeling they will go to an adult they trust, weather it be a teacher at school or a parent or even a friend at achool."
8287,1fff20c5639e,People that think that the face was created by alliens think that beacuase they probably heard that from someone else or someone told them without having any real facts
8288,d407b8905805,But if we go into more details i remember once i read/seen something about that there might be some alliens out there in space.
8289,d407b8905805,The face of the earth was created by natrual landform as NASA has said.
8290,d407b8905805,"On May 24,2001 a spacecraft was circling around when they fount a shadowy figure like a human face!"
8291,d407b8905805,The thing is how will we ever know the real truth behind that.
8292,d407b8905805,Yeah i know people tell us differnt things but how will we know witch one to belive out of all them.
8293,d407b8905805,We obviosly have to belive NASA because they are the ones that go up there often and let us know if there is anything new up there.
8294,909fe7d88e71,Its not like we can go up there anytime we want and cheke for ourselfs!
8295,909fe7d88e71,The bad thing is that we will never find out for our ownselfs but thats just the way things are!
8296,45cc778bd831,"In ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,""the author suggests that studying planet Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangerous it presents"
8297,8e51a0790934,"Since Venus is the closet planet to Earth in terms of density and size, the distance are similar too."
8298,8e51a0790934,This planet has different speeds.
8299,8e51a0790934,"Though, humans have sent many spacecrafts to this dangerous land."
8300,8e51a0790934,Each mission was unmanned sicne no spacecraft ever survived the landing for a few hours.
8301,503e3955480d,Some dangerous this planet planet presents
8302,5607aadd7ffc,the atmosphere is thick and is almost 97 percent of carbon dioxide.
8303,5607aadd7ffc,The clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in the atmosphere and the conditions are more extreme than human encounter in Earth.
8304,5607aadd7ffc,"""Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solor system, even though Mercury is closeer to our Sun""(Paragraph 3)."
8305,5607aadd7ffc,"It has so much heat and pressure and the weather presents additional dangerous which are, erupting volcanoes,powerful earthquakes, and excesive amount of lighting strikes."
8306,79d4ccfad82a,This dangerous can really affect humans and humans won't really be able to survive in that planet.
8307,e31d22643b42,Scientists believe Venus was once covered largely wiht oceans and could of supported forms of life
8308,6d02241179a8,scientists are now able to knwo more about technology and ivent new spacecrafts.
8309,6d02241179a8,We now have new information of the Planet Venus
8310,91c24afc9cc4,"Now, we know it's surface is rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."
8311,2af9dfdc40a0,"In conclusion, I think the more we learn the more we can be able to experience more things and have more knwoledge."
8312,2af9dfdc40a0,Technology has been playin a big part of this situations and expriences.
8313,2af9dfdc40a0,The more technology advances the more we will be able to exprience more.
8314,4be5e6c32e08,My principal has decided that students should do at least on extracurricular activity
8315,b54740fbd07c,I disagree with this because i think that students can do what they feel like doing and not be forced into something.
8316,fbe165be8ef2,This will probably change a lot of things
8317,32a0b05cabd6,We will be forced to do sports some students dont't like sports either they're not fit for it or they just don't like sports at all.
8318,e74c522b464a,Some people might want to work on there yearbooks but not everyone gets yearbooks.
8319,c121007634e6,The student council i don't feel like any student would really want to do it.
8320,d3f98694c2fa,Because what will it be about what will they say they might hurt or say something a student does not want to hear.
8321,506dcafcf9bb,Sports what will they will have to do and what they will need.
8322,506dcafcf9bb,In sports you have to have the equipment your so pose to have for that sport.
8323,506dcafcf9bb,"It could be Baseball, Football, Basketball or Soccer and whatever sport there is chosen for that student."
8324,506dcafcf9bb,Most sports you have to do conditioning so you have to run a lot and some people don't like running.
8325,506dcafcf9bb,Some people are not athletic and there just not good enough for sports.
8326,506dcafcf9bb,They might want to have a job and trying to go for what they want to do later in life.
8327,506dcafcf9bb,A lot of sports you can get seriously injured and some students might not want that to happen to them.
8328,5fe909312e60,What is wrong with the yearbook.
8329,5fe909312e60,What are they going to do with the yearbook because all you have to do is set the students that took there picture in alphabetical order.
8330,5fe909312e60,What will they do when there done with It.
8331,5fe909312e60,There not going to let a lot of people do it because you don't need half the school.
8332,5fe909312e60,Plus It's going to be hard if everyone wants to do the yearbooks.
8333,b05a05f62861,What will they do with the student council.
8334,b05a05f62861,I don't think this is a good idea at all because hoe are they going to go threw the whole school for whatever they have to say to every individual student.
8335,b05a05f62861,It might take a while for a lot of students or it might be quick.
8336,b05a05f62861,It's going to be hard because some people are good and don't need it.
8337,a130be310a53,I think these things are bad ideas.
8338,a130be310a53,I don't think this will be good because students want to focus on there education and to go for an higher future.
8339,fa27249e1ccd,Why should you join the Seagoing Cowboys program?
8340,c191235bb1b1,you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program
8341,ab3b11a153fb,you could help people over seas and in other countries.
8342,181808396ba1,"A boy named Luke Bomberger got to do all of the things that you could be able to do, by joining the Seagoing Cowboys program."
8343,dad8537a10e5,you could get to see many unique places all over the world.
8344,71caf28acded,A lot of people do not get to see some of the things that you could be able to see during the Seagoing Cowboys program.
8345,71caf28acded,"After the animals are unloaded and you have some free time, you could so site seeing and do all of it for free!"
8346,71caf28acded,Luke Bomberger got to do this while visiting many different countries for free.
8347,71caf28acded,Now that is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
8348,cd0c9aadf783,you could travel all over the world for free!
8349,878ae7dd8a93,That is a once in a lifetime opportunity.
8350,878ae7dd8a93,You don't get to travel to places for free very often.
8351,878ae7dd8a93,Luke Bomberger had the chance to go to many different countries and see many different things in those countries.
8352,16b30dda34b1,"when you are in the different countries and you have freetime over in those places, is that you can meet people and learn their about cutures."
8353,4259e5150ec7,"Luke got to go see and meet new people during his free time while people were still unloading the animals, and probably learned new things about those peoples cultures too."
8354,92444990a713,you can learn a lot of survival skills on the ships that you are on.
8355,e85bccd5bdbe,"If you ever are a capatin of a ship in the Seagoing Cowboys program or in any program, is that you will already know how to control a ship, keep your ship members in order, and know what to do when you are on that ship."
8356,e85bccd5bdbe,Luke Bomberger got to learn a few things on how to contol a ship and what to do when a storm hits and you sail right through the storm.
8357,6dbfad5d5213,you could meet new people on the ship and get to know them
8358,9db28401c8ec,A lot of people do not have friends or just want to be more social.
8359,9db28401c8ec,A way you could do that is by joining the program.
8360,9db28401c8ec,"After all of the animals are unloaded and you are heading back to your home to pick up more animals, you could play games with some of your ship members."
8361,9db28401c8ec,"Luke Bomberger got to meet new people and probably made some new friends while on some of those trips, even though he already had a friend that was going with him on the ships and things."
8362,3a795618b1ae,you can spend a lot of time with animals.
8363,fd09da94e00f,"After you are finished with the program, and you need to find a job, you could open a new farm and already know how to take care of most of your animals."
8364,fd09da94e00f,When Luke was on the ship he already knew how to take care of the animals but he probable go to learn new things on how to take care of them.
8365,27eaa262290f,Those are the reasons why you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.
8366,27eaa262290f,"You get to help people, see unique places, you could travel all ofver the world, you get to learn about peoples cultures, you can learn a alot of survival skills, you can meet new people on the ship and make friends, and you get to learn a lot about animals and how to take care of them."
8367,27eaa262290f,Those are some of the many reasons you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.
8368,87bb472ef800,Luke didn't paticipate in the Seagoing Cowboys because he hat to stay at home.
8369,87bb472ef800,And because he had just graduated from high school.
8370,87bb472ef800,he didn't think it was nessisary to go and he had a leave at home even tho he had a family at home.
8371,87bb472ef800,He didn't want to just leave them at home with out him.
8372,87bb472ef800,Becuase he had no one to watch them when they was at home alone with no one to talk to.
8373,87bb472ef800,He desided to stay and not go so he can be there with them and he was going to pertect them from harmes way.
8374,87bb472ef800,he loved his family to much to just leaver to join a cowboy group with people her didn't know at all so he said No and that he was staying with them.
8375,87bb472ef800,Because if he would have left it would proboly change ther life and his forever.
8376,87bb472ef800,they didn't want to stay home by there self for a long time he wanted to stay and help them out around there house and other stuff.

8379,42fd2a83aa95,"""SCORE!"
8380,42fd2a83aa95,"Three points to the Wildcats,"" an announcer exclaims."
8381,42fd2a83aa95,"The crowd goes absolutely wild, and the players feel proud about their effort."
8382,42fd2a83aa95,Basketball is only one of the many amazing and exciting extracurricular activities students have the privilege to pick from.
8383,42fd2a83aa95,"There's a variety to what's available, from art to softball to helping produce the school yearbook."
8384,42fd2a83aa95,"Each of those activities are creative, entertaining, and helpful one way or another."
8385,42fd2a83aa95,"In addition, our principal has decided that all students should take part in at least one extracurricular activity."
8386,42fd2a83aa95,"As a result, some students are complaining and disapproving about this decision while others, such as me, think this is an opportunity for students to have a incredible time doing whatever activity they choose."
8387,ddc45b422e5e,Our school should have these extracurricular activities
8388,de22ec3545c0,"because it gives students a chance to socialize with new people,"
8389,c7a7ff1bb009,"learn new skills and experience new things,"
8390,b1cee69b8595,entertain themselves while impacting the school as well as the community.
8391,1ded58c9dd1d,"To elaborate, drama, or theater, involves everyone to communicate with each other to create a scene that will dazzle the audience."
8392,1ded58c9dd1d,"They must decide how to react, talk, and act to one another to make the performance truly spectacular."
8393,1ded58c9dd1d,"Additionally, students don't just see their classmates when they go to their chosen activity, there are other kids from other grades there as well, so it's the perfect chance to meet unfamiliar people, and chat with familiar people, too."
8394,1ded58c9dd1d,"To add to that, the activity likely brings out skills in others that you didn't know they had, and that enables students to connect with one another and find out more about each other."
8395,69e9fcef5661,Most activity leaders allow field trips at least once a year.
8396,69e9fcef5661,"As an effect, students get to go places they've never been before, and if they have, they get to share their experience at that place with different people."
8397,69e9fcef5661,"Also, multiple activities, such as art, teach students to make certain things."
8398,69e9fcef5661,"In artistic cases, you get to learn about pottery, clay, watercolor and acrylic painting, different drawing tools, and more."
8399,69e9fcef5661,"In addition, music lets you explore your voice, public speaking lets you learn how to be a motivational speaker, marching band lets you play more pieces of music with your instrument, and experience more with it, and so many more activities teach you a variety of different things."
8400,e72ea6eecccb,"For example, teens in charge of the yearbook have a entertaining time making sure their product is pleasing to the eye, so that our school has something valuable to sell to students, and so that they can look back on all the great memories they had at our precious school."
8401,e72ea6eecccb,"Nevertheless, at the same time they're expressing their creativity into the book."
8402,e72ea6eecccb,"Also, the art students create posters and fliers to advertise upcoming school events so that everyone can enjoy that event with their friends."
8403,e72ea6eecccb,"I know by experience that creating colorful, bright papers is a fun-filled activity to do."
8404,e72ea6eecccb,"Plus, some students who are in the Environment Protection Youths of Virginia group volunteer to pick up litter along the sidewalks, in parks, and many other places that would harm the environment of our beloved state if they weren't cleared and cleaned."
8405,e72ea6eecccb,They have a wonderful time doing just that while chatting to their friends.
8406,2dadc48b8b27,"To summarize, because students get to socialize with people they never got the opportunity to talk to before, experience new things and get taught new skills, and impact the community as well as themselves, I believe extracurricular activities should definitely be included at our school."
8407,2dadc48b8b27,"They are a very bright part of anyone's day, something that a kid could look forward to on a boring Monday."
8408,2dadc48b8b27,"Also, they could find out new things they didn't have a clue about."
8409,2dadc48b8b27,"A teen gets to talk to others near their age group who started out just being part of a crowd, but because they met them while playing the part of Juliet, they turned into a best friend."
8410,2dadc48b8b27,"Additionally, we get to help the whole state while having a incredible time."
8411,2dadc48b8b27,"So whether it's the applause of an audience at a play, the encouraging comment of a friend on a picture, or the announcement of a score it took a team effort to achieve, the activity that got someone there made a mark on their heart."
8412,ad131938feac,Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers because Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky and human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.
8413,a13bd18b6f9b,"Venus's knickname is sometimes called the ""Evening Star"" mainly because Venus is simple to see from the distant but safe vantage point of Earth has proved a very challenging place to examine closely."
8414,a13bd18b6f9b,"It is also called the ""Evening Star"" because Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."
8415,a13bd18b6f9b,"On Venus, the temperatures average over 800 degrees Farenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than on Earth."
8416,46cde515ee1a,These conditions are far more extreme than anything human would encounter on Earth.
8417,fc35886ff045,It is not suprising that the temperature average is so high given the fact that Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system.
8418,fc35886ff045,"So basically, if you walk on Venus you will get burns."
8419,fc35886ff045,Studying Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky because it is simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot.
8420,fc35886ff045,"Yes, Venus has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely, but although it is not clear due to the fact that 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus, it is still simple to see from the distant, safe vantage point."
8421,fc35886ff045,No spacecraft survived for more than a few hours because of the carbon dioxide blanketing clouds of Venus.
8422,fc35886ff045,The clouds of Venus most likely explains why not a single spacecraft torched down on Venus for more than three decades.
8423,fc35886ff045,Venus's atmosphere at night is not affected by carbon dioxide of highly corrosive sulfuric acid.
8424,fc35886ff045,This is exactly why studying Venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky is simple for an amateur stargazer to spot.
8425,2c46f4fb275d,Studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.
8426,8766eca52a97,Venus has value because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself just like intimidating endeavors does as well.
8427,8766eca52a97,"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts, it should only be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."
8428,8766eca52a97,This helps to strive to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value.
8429,90f6cea6cc76,"So, because our travels should not be limited by dangers and doubts, intimidating endeavors should only be expanded to meet the imagination and innovation of the travel."
8430,90f6cea6cc76,"So, because Venus is simple to see from the distant and because our travels should be expanded, studying Venus is a worthy pursuit because it only presents a small amount of dangers."
8431,90f6cea6cc76,"So, If Venus was more of a dangerous planet to explore, walk on, and study, would this be a planet that everyone would be interested to study and afraid to walk on to explore?"
8432,03e66ebd46db,"There are many ways to learn new things, through experience, being taught, and a multitude of other ways to obtain new information."
8433,03e66ebd46db,School is the perfect place to learn new things from teachers that have extensive experience in their specific area of expertise.
8434,03e66ebd46db,It is the teacher's and administration's job to help provide a well-rounded education for their students and part of that is assigning work that the students do not want to do.
8435,03e66ebd46db,Summer projects are important so the students continue to use their brain and learn how to retain information.
8436,8b7e5305d2a1,Teachers should design the projects
8437,e844bfd20bbe,"they know the material,"
8438,3dee8737c85f,"have experience making lessons and projects,"
8439,9ab997fd5d20,if it was student designed then the work would be almost non-existent.
8440,6f6e43de1bac,"In order to become a teacher, one has to go to college and earn a degree along with a teaching license and certification."
8441,6f6e43de1bac,Years of studying and mastering the material provides them with the tools needed to teach their students the subject.
8442,6f6e43de1bac,Students go to school in order to learn.
8443,6f6e43de1bac,"If they do not know the material, how do they have any qualifications to design a project that would make sure that they learned everything required by the school district, state, or country?"
8444,6f6e43de1bac,People go to school in order to become teachers because they want to help their students learn and grow.
8445,6f6e43de1bac,"Not only is it the subject the teachers are teaching to them, but life skills and tools they can use in the future."
8446,6f6e43de1bac,"If all the work that the students did was up to them, they would lack important skills like researching and communication that could help them in internships and the work world."
8447,31c4e9bd795d,"Charts, flip charts, and simulations are all used by most teachers to show information that is important."
8448,31c4e9bd795d,"In the summer, students aren't going to want to do homework regardless but if the project is set up with clear and concise directions, it makes the work seem less daunting otherwise."
8449,31c4e9bd795d,"For example, if a student had planned a project, the project would only make sense to them because they are responsible for planning it out and the steps needed."
8450,31c4e9bd795d,"When that transfers onto paper, other students won't know what is happening in the brain of the student who created it and will be confused."
8451,6571c64d669c,"If students were given the opportunity to create their own summer assignment, it would most likely end up being under 5 questions with minimal work needed to be done in order to complete it."
8452,6571c64d669c,"This does not help the students in any way, shape, or form."
8453,6571c64d669c,Teenagers look for the quick and easy results that aren't as available as they think in the real world.
8454,6571c64d669c,The point of high school is to prepare you for college.
8455,6571c64d669c,If the work you do in high school is easy and not challenging there is a greater risk for those students to struggle more in college with the huge increase in course work.
8456,6571c64d669c,There are some students who crave the challenge and look for the ability to better themselves.
8457,48e3b0d91f00,If they had the opportunity to create their own project it would be beneficial to them because they are willing to put in the work.
8458,d35ce1017b60,"Teachers can't trust that all students are like that though because each kid is different and most likely, when given the chance, the student will take the day to go to the pool rather than sit at home and do their own research about Stem Cell research."
8459,9886a043997e,"Education, is in the hands of each individual and what they choose to make of it is up to them, but teachers should be there to guide and educate their students into making the right choices with their education."
8460,9886a043997e,"Although at the time, their students might respond to the summer assignment with a groan, it is in their best interest to do the work assigned to them by their teacher."
8461,9886a043997e,Summer projects should be created by their teachers instead of themselves because teachers know what is important and they know what tools and resources to use in order to learn something new.
8462,9886a043997e,Students have to realize that teachers want what is best for them and want them to be able to succeed in life.
8463,69c32e020215,The use of technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is valuable
8464,2e7a4bb9bee9,The reason for this is that you can tell weather the person is really smiling or not
8465,f5dba8bdf97f,"The computer software FACS (Facial Action Coding System) can classify 6 basic emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."
8466,f5dba8bdf97f,The passage states that the computer contructs a 3-D computer model of the face;all 44 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles.
8467,f5dba8bdf97f,Movement of one or more muscles is called an 'action unit.
8468,f5dba8bdf97f,"The passage also states that using video imagery, the new emotion-recongnintion software tracks these facial movments-in a real face or in the painted face of Monia Lisa."
8469,f5dba8bdf97f,It can even identify mixed emotions.
8470,f5dba8bdf97f,Each exspression is compared against a neutral face
8471,913197273bd4,The computer can tell weather you are happy or sad
8472,36f99fe1255d,"Like in the passage it says that for an example, if you smile when a web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow."
8473,36f99fe1255d,"But if you frown, the next ad will be different"
8474,f4afeeb9d84a,"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it can modify the lesson like an effective human instructor."
8475,94d42fde27b7,The evidence from this passage shows that the use of this technology to read the emotional exspressions of students in a classroom is very helpful.
8476,94d42fde27b7,"like stated in the claim and passage ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."""
8477,6a7b766263e0,"In ""The challenge of the Exploring Venus"" it shows alot of the good and bad of studies that will help us understand why the author suggest that studying venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents."
8478,e98fcf6cc9bf,The article stated that it is one of the brightest point of light in the sky.
8479,e5de71efe724,Vince is the 2rd closest plant to the sun
8480,94ad7738724a,which meaning 800 degrees fahrenheit and the presseure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.
8481,94ad7738724a,"170 degrees fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth, although Venus has the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even though Mercury is closer to our sun, if humans lived there ther could be a chance of additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and freqent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface."
8482,94ad7738724a,"Otherwise the planet would still have some efatures that are analogous to those on Earth such like Valleys, mountains,and craters."
8483,d1676764591c,Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for planetary visit.
8484,da18cd87d51d,Asronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may erll once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system and i trust that the astronomers would say that because we still think that Mar would be our planetary visit.
8485,da18cd87d51d,"Although humans have sent numerous spacecrafts to land on the ""cloud-draped world"" as they call it."
8486,da18cd87d51d,"They have said that no spacecraft has survived the landing for more than a few hours ,despite its proximity to us and, of course should like a big danger and risk to take, not easy conditions, but survivable for humans."
8487,da18cd87d51d,NASA's possibile solution to hostile conditions on the surface Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray.
8488,8f5970bdcb96,"Researcher cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance, Venus would need to get uo close and personal"
8489,abfcd8bd1d8d,"despite the risks, they are working on innovations that allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of venus, and some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simlating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions."
8490,abfcd8bd1d8d,"But now they use mechanical computers which were first envisioned in the 1800s and played lots of important roles in the 1940s, by comparison systems that use mechanical parts can be more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces."
8491,592e5fe65087,What i think of all of this is that the author us right to suggest that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit depite the danger and chaos it represents human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.
8492,592e5fe65087,Our travels on Eather and beyond should not be limited by dangers and boubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation as the article stated.
8493,592e5fe65087,"The astronomers of today they shall wonder off to make Venus a both safe and scienctifically productive, and the people of todays world would be amazing at all the thing that is happening or what will happened to Venus."
8494,960cc278e5b6,I do not agree with technology to read students emotional expressions should be used because it is just a waste of money.
8495,5b9512fa67e3,I honestly believe that teachers or former students should know when someone is upset angry or happy.
8496,5b9512fa67e3,I mean it would be irrelavent for a school to spend thouasands of dollars to know when someone is upset.
8497,5b9512fa67e3,Teachers should be able to see if their own students would be upset.
8498,aa48584a0ccf,Schools could spend the money on more important things
8499,ea20e952fb6f,like for textbooks gym equipment sports classrooms or even build another part to the school not some emotion detector
8500,113a82aaafde,But hey it is 2018 anything could happen.
8501,113a82aaafde,"In paragraph 5 it states ""In fact, we humans perform this same impressive ""calculation"" every day."
8502,113a82aaafde,"For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face."""
8503,113a82aaafde,DR. Huang predicts.
8504,113a82aaafde,"""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."""
8505,113a82aaafde,How could that even work.
8506,72226250b5bf,In this artical the auther explains why exploring Venus is a good idea
8507,8cd13fdcb80f,"by stating that it is the closest to earth in size,dencity,and mass aswell as being the cosest in distance."
8508,d047a3b33cc0,He aso states that it could help us get better at sace travel.
8509,1458742e43d8,In paragrah one he is talking about how Venus is closely similar to Earth in size shae an mass by saying
8510,842d898fe05e,"Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of Density and size, and occasinally the closest in distance too."""
8511,4484fc2f4be7,He also states in paragrah five that NASA is working on a methid to buuild on Venus by having large floting blimps that fly over the death and missery of the planets serfice.
8512,4608e882ab60,exploring Benus could also bring about new methids of taraforming to make a planets serfice hospidible.
8513,4608e882ab60,Exploring Venus could also bring about new ways to space travle and new technology.
8514,81f11863ef04,"
In paragraph seven the auther mentions mechanical computers that dont relay on electricity and small and insitive chips but insted rely on gears and clock works."
8515,7f3b6812cbd3,"So all in all exploring venus is a goodish idea if we can figure out how to actualy , one make it there and two figure out how to sistain a perminant bace."
8516,7f3b6812cbd3,there is plenty of good evidence in this artical about space exploration and the such and why i think Venus is an exoplanet (a planet that culd or has sistain life)
8517,70b338bf61ff,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" a man creates a program that can detect human emotion."
8518,70b338bf61ff,That man is Professor Thomas Huang.
8519,70b338bf61ff,The program he created can detect on how a person is truly feeling.
8520,70b338bf61ff,"I only know 6 emotions so far and they are happiness, anger, sadness, surprise, fear, and disgust"
8521,a6a048db52f3,The program could lead to major scientific/artistic break throughs.
8522,8cddfb5a0c2a,The program uses muscle identification to determine what emotion the person is making.
8523,b98caeb803a4,A specific muscle is used to make an emotion.
8524,b98caeb803a4,"For example, the zygomatic major is used to move the lips up to make a smile."
8525,b98caeb803a4,"The zygomatic major and the risorius is used to force a smile like if you feel awkward, depressed, or upset but doesn't want to show it."
8526,b98caeb803a4,So even the program can tell if you are forcing a smile or you are actually happily smiling.
8527,c76404cbc69e,Expressing emotions everyday could improve how you actually feel and you may get more out of life than you would with a straight face
8528,7ccc54b5e182,"People will think you are are happy if you smile, sad if you frown, content if you have a straight face, etc."
8529,7ccc54b5e182,"People analyze how you are feeling to share iin your happiness, make you feel better so you are no longer sad, and calm you down if you are angry."
8530,07b42be5f578,"With this program, people can now understand human emotions better than than naked eye."
8531,07b42be5f578,"This kind of program could be used in therapy sessions, doctor's offices, and hospitals."
8532,963aa8586c71,"This artical,""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" is the authors way to give ideas on how to help get closer to Venus"
8533,3e9124ffb4ff,the author starts out with how and what Venus looks like.
8534,3e9124ffb4ff,"The author also compares Venus to Earth and says ""[It's] Often reffered to as Earth's ""twin.""'"
8535,bc9be1522ffc,"The author's article, ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" has a very good look into why we need to explore and learn more about Venus."
8536,bc9be1522ffc,The athor even gives ideas/ways for NASA to be able to explore Venus.
8537,bc9be1522ffc,"Examples like ""...NASA's possible solution to the hostile conditions on the surface of Venus would allow scientists to float above the fray."""
8538,bc9be1522ffc,This is one of the few ideas that the author gives out.
8539,bc9be1522ffc,"The whole artical is about how Venus is so like Earth or ""Earth's ""twin.""'"
8540,bc9be1522ffc,"This is a good artical to look for if looking up ideas for a essay because it gives facts like ""...Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size."""
8541,bc9be1522ffc,"Or facts about the devices that they used in the pass that didn't work like ""...simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface..."""
8542,a028a4eb5b86,"To end off on a good term, the author had put in time to let people know that we should think smarter not harder to be able to see closer into what Venus is hiding."
8543,a028a4eb5b86,"The Author says ""...Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doughts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation."""
8544,a028a4eb5b86,This meaning not to thing to hard and work with what you got insted of thinking of a way to get all information right away.
8545,754bda8304f3,Studying venus would be really interesting but venus is hard to study because it´s dangerous and it has really high pressure.
8546,6d61e10f305e,Venus is sometimes known as earth´s twin because venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size.
8547,5dd989a9048c,Scientist have tried to get to get numerous spacecrafts on venus but no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours.
8548,5dd989a9048c,Venus is one of the hardest planet to study and research.
8549,5dd989a9048c,It´s hard for astrounauts to go to venus because temperature is over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what humans experience on our own planet.
8550,71438a644ee0,If NASA sent humans to venus it would be really hard for the astronauts to land because it has hostile conditions on the surface of venus.
8551,edd92e0ea631,When the humans would land on venus the air pressure would be close to some of the levels in the sea and the temperature would be toasty.
8552,980f08f94996,"In conclusion, venus has challenging things it presents and it would make it very hard for people in NASA to put human life on a planet that has very high air pressure and temperature that we are not used having on earth."
8553,c9377d2e5f4a,Every summer students are required to complete a project to ensure learning is being accomplished.
8554,c9377d2e5f4a,Some say that these projects should be teacher-designed others say they should be student-designed.
8555,c9377d2e5f4a,"A high school student once stated that "" a project over the summer sounds boring ""."
8556,c9377d2e5f4a,Others must think how can one make a project during summer fun if its teacher-designed?
8557,69ae7f51cffa,Summer projects should be student-designed
8558,ebb061130c39,"it makes each student want to be creative,"
8559,aa83e041a0aa,"enthusiastic,"
8560,8bd91f4829ac,have better learning opportunities.
8561,cac45b36d547,Critics say that summer projects should be teacher designed because it keeps the student following a stricted guideline.
8562,60d90aca721d,"Although following a specific guild line ensures the student will complete the required task thoroughly, it forbids the act of joy."
8563,60d90aca721d,"Students are already in school for ten months of the year following a stricted guideline in how to complete a certain assignment, if schools assign a teacher-designed project over the summer it would feel as if they are coming in the way of students summer break."
8564,60d90aca721d,If this project is teacher-designed it would also show students that schools are more biased towards their opinions.
8565,b52ba2bc3fe9,A student would show creativity by choosing the colors they like or making it into something that shows significance to them.
8566,b52ba2bc3fe9,This would give the project more depth and meaning rather than a simple teacher-designed assignment.
8567,b52ba2bc3fe9,Creativity is important in a student's life because it helps speak what is on their mind and generate from there.
8568,b52ba2bc3fe9,Completing a regular teacher-designed project would restrict the idea of building from your life and experience.
8569,ef0f1c0f104b,"On a usual school assignment students wait till the last minute and stress about what to and how to do it, with being able to design your project there would be less procrastination and more completion."
8570,ef0f1c0f104b,"With student-design projects each student has more options in what they can create, making them look forward to completing the task with excitement."
8571,ef0f1c0f104b,"Most school assignments don't entertain students while accomplishing them, if schools let students design their summer project they can make it fun."
8572,ef0f1c0f104b,"For an example, a group of students can plan on working on this project together and be enthusiastic because their options are open and would also give them the ability to help each other with new ideas."
8573,18ca3fe386d8,If students have the ability to design their own project they would be choosing what they have to do the research on.
8574,18ca3fe386d8,This would increase learning because it would interest an individual student and make them want to gain more knowledge about a specific topic.
8575,18ca3fe386d8,"Another way learning opportunities are increased because after the completion of this project, teachers could asses the student on proving that they actually learned over the break."
8576,18ca3fe386d8,This would also benefit the teacher in learning something new.
8577,2037006d4b19,"summer projects should be student-designed because it promotes creativity, makes it enthusiastic, and increases knowledge."
8578,2037006d4b19,"Completing a creative, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable project over the summer sounds far more entertaining than a teacher-designed project."
8579,2037006d4b19,"With creativity you can make the project interesting, with enthusiasm you can make the project fun, and with knowledge you can never have enough."
8580,2037006d4b19,Students would have an entertaining and educating summer all in one.
8581,bc6b6c36a83d,"Plan:A photo from 1998,is a pciture of a mask."

8588,98f1dd848c72,"So basically it tell the readers or the scientist thatat some point of time their was humans on ""Planet Mars"",and really they're trying to get them to realized just because its a""huge rock formation"" what if they'rereally humans skulls under all of the rocks?"
8589,5308de912b13,"The Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars evidence that NASA would rather hide,say conspriacy theorists."
8590,5ca04af83ab2,"This shows that NASA was trying to keep it a sercet that theirs are head with a mouth,eyes,noes,and ears on Mars and they wasn't trying to put in no type of effort to get deeper in the situation or not even assummed is not normal for a planet that has nobody lived on and has a unusal head that just poped up out of nowhere on ""Planet Mars""."
8591,000835cf1a9e,"The author of this work is in favor of taking on the great challenge of landing a ""rover"" on Venus for research and exploration."
8592,000835cf1a9e,Venus has many extreme conditions that the earth does not have to endure.
8593,ce287f022732,"The author presented many ""solutions"" to these problems."
8594,ce287f022732,"Although plausible, the creations would be impractical and would not produce ensured results."
8595,ce287f022732,The author's support for the idea of exploring Venus is mediocre at best.
8596,26e8013b3cba,Being the second-closest planet to the sun provides for some nearly impossible conditions for human exploration.
8597,24057dbf6c2f,"With Sulfuric Acid in Venus' atmosphere, and surface temperatures being over 425 degrees Celcius (about 700 K or 800 F) , the likelyhood of humans on Venus is nearly nonexistent to begin with."
8598,24057dbf6c2f,"To combat the hot temperatures and the acidic atmosphere, NASA proposed the idea of a ""blimp"" that floats above the planet's shell."
8599,24057dbf6c2f,"Although the blimp could survive high in the air, the practicality of if is not present."
8600,24057dbf6c2f,Having a blimp that cannot touch the planet is not going to help scientific research at all.
8601,24057dbf6c2f,"While being above the clouds of Venus, it is impossible to see the surface with human eyes."
8602,24057dbf6c2f,Seeing the surface would require technology that uses light from the electromagnetic spectrum with a high frequency and short wavelength.
8603,24057dbf6c2f,It is also impossible to collect rock samples from the planet for soil examination.
8604,24057dbf6c2f,This idea would not be beneficial enough for the risk of investing a lot of time and money.
8605,921e8c7f6fcc,"An additional idea that was brought up by the author was ""Silicon electronics."""
8606,1e2b16f4ea63,Siliscon electronics would be resistent to the harsh conditions on the planet-- for a while.
8607,1e2b16f4ea63,The systems would run for about a month before total failure.
8608,1e2b16f4ea63,these silicon systems are very expensive to bein with and are still in the development phase here on earth.
8609,1e2b16f4ea63,Creating enough silicon circuits to power a rover or vehicle would take years to manufacture.
8610,1e2b16f4ea63,"And by the point of satisfactory innovation for silicon electronics, a new product may have been presented."
8611,448a3d9e8693,"Lastly, a ""cave-man"" idea of mechanical computers came into play."
8612,89943fb98e1f,These basic forms of work require no fragile electronics at all.
8613,89943fb98e1f,"Using gears, levers, pulleys, and ramrods, corporations have been able to create many devices."
8614,89943fb98e1f,"When made out of an acid-resistent substance that can withstand high pressure, a mechanical machine may work."
8615,89943fb98e1f,"The only problem with a mechanical machine is that once on the planet, sure it can do work, but it would be unable to transmit and data findings back to a receiver on a ship or earth."
8616,89943fb98e1f,There would be a point where some sort of electronics would be needed.
8617,89943fb98e1f,"And as of right now, there is not an effective enough invention that could put humans on Venus to live and research."
8618,6381a8844b86,The author of this article is trying to push a principle that is not fully developed yet.
8619,b23284e68358,"The reasons that were provided may work after many years of design and development, but right now, none are practical."
8620,b23284e68358,A combination of the three presented ideas may actually work the best.
8621,b23284e68358,"Use a blimp to float above the planet, tie a cable to the blimp that connects is with machanical machinery, and use silicon electronics to transmit the findings."
8622,b23284e68358,Damage could be repaired by raising the equipment back up to the blimp.
8623,b23284e68358,"Innovation does not come easy for those who are in charge of it, but ideas like this are needed in providing an answer for a difficult question."
8624,ec0b35cc4a73,"Overall, the author's arguments do not satisfy the overall risk and reward stakes."
8625,ec0b35cc4a73,"After more time passes, maybe he will write another article depicting what will work for sure."
8626,ec0b35cc4a73,The support was not presented in a way that was convincing enough to dive right in to this new frontier of space.
8627,f70950b5f45c,"Good Afternoon, You may know me as Dr. Ema R. I'm Head Scientist down at NASA."
8628,f70950b5f45c,So today I'm going to tell you about the 'Face on Mars' some people think its just a funky looking rock.
8629,f70950b5f45c,Well my friends they are wrong.
8630,f70950b5f45c,Now your going to move on to my studying and research I have done to find out what it is and I'm pretty sure I found the right answer.
8631,1166e6ce8111,"The 'Face on Mars' was found by us NASA, in 1976."
8632,1166e6ce8111,It got very popular over the years then.
8633,3cfca33f8251,"By popular I mean appearing in a Hollywood film, books, magazines, radio, and even talk shows."
8634,3cfca33f8251,"Now, I know what your thinking."
8635,3cfca33f8251,What was so popular about a landform on a planet other than ours?
8636,3cfca33f8251,"Well first, its not a landform, and second lets be completly honest here, if you were looking through a telescope and saw a face in the sky what would you do?"
8637,3cfca33f8251,You wouldn't shake it off and go to bed.
8638,3cfca33f8251,"At least I wouldn't, I would be showing it to everyone and try to turn it into NASA because you would be a hero for maybe finding life on another planet."
8639,42fe3149e8a4,The work I did on Mars made me think that we aren't the only planet with life
8640,ccb3866ff452,"This 'Face' isn't a landform, its a lifeform."
8641,72ed9563a5e4,"thats what all the faces on Mars, if there is life, look like"
8642,3a1278593c02,When life on Mars dies they will bury them like we do.
8643,3a1278593c02,"Also, the way this 'Face' appeared there when it was buried."
8644,3a1278593c02,It got buried there forever ago and now the skull is popping up.
8645,b17fd53f637a,The leaders would put it into motion and try to find more life forms or signs of life
8646,dfd562785fa4,"Maybe these forms there, don't need to live with water and oxygen like we do they may just have to live off of sunlight or dirt maybe something crazy like that."
8647,dfd562785fa4,NASA will one day find more evidence of lights on other planets.
8648,3df00fd54286,"Studying Venus can be a good thing to do, you will learn more about the planet and why it is our sister planet to us"
8649,a18cd38e6b08,You will have a lot of information and reasonings on why it's that planet or why is it close to the sun.
8650,a18cd38e6b08,The text gives you a lot of information about venus and why it is called that.
8651,a18cd38e6b08,"As it states ""long ago when venus was covered with nothing but the ocean"", they could of had human life on that planet."
8652,a18cd38e6b08,You can study venus and maybe found out if there was any human life their besides the oceans that were their.
8653,a18cd38e6b08,You can be the one who goes to space and can take a look at venus and if it's safe you can probably visit the planet
8654,d02e47e5f69e,"I suggest that it is a good idea to study venus, you might have a chance to visit the planet venus."
8655,39909537c641,"Summer break is oftentimes associated with the stagnation of learning, and the loss of accumulated learning from the previous school year."
8656,39909537c641,"To counteract this, some schools have implemented a system of summer projects to ensure that learning never stops, even during a break."
8657,c4d4e445f590,"in lieu of traditional teacher-designed projects, students should be able to dictate, for themselves, what summer project they wish to accomplish."
8658,652028da6041,"While some may argue that student-designed projects encourage lazy and uninspired design, by designing projects themselves,"
8659,3071121ffa96,students are more likely to have the time and motivation to complete them than if a teacher had designed them.
8660,07f92f603587,"By having students design their own projects, it increases the likelihood that they have some interest in the completion of said project."
8661,25a73b9c667c,"This is because by allowing them to dictate what their project is about, it ensures that the student will select a topic that is interesting to them."
8662,25a73b9c667c,This concept of self-selection is already applied to schooling today.
8663,25a73b9c667c,"For example, the ubiquitous science fair."
8664,25a73b9c667c,"Within a science fair project, students select a topic and create a science experiment surrounding that topic."
8665,25a73b9c667c,"By allowing students the freedom to select and design their own science experiment they are interested in, they learn and engage more than if they had, for example, participated in an in-class lab."
8666,25a73b9c667c,"This is especially important for a summer project due to the fact that, during summer break, students would rather relax than do school work."
8667,25a73b9c667c,Especially so if the alternative was to work on a project that they had no say in creating.
8668,25a73b9c667c,"Essentially, ensuring students are assigned a project they are interested in ensures that they accomplish some learning over their break."
8669,b8869c7672ca,laziness is not the sole reason a student may not complete a summer project.
8670,b8869c7672ca,"It is possible that they, or their family, have plans that conflict with the completion of an assigned project."
8671,b8869c7672ca,"For example, if a student were traveling to a location where they did not have access to resources or materials to complete a project."
8672,b8869c7672ca,"Or, if a student took on a summer job and the assigned task was too time-consuming to work on in conjunction with their job."
8673,b8869c7672ca,There are a variety of reasons a student may not be able to complete a project.
8674,b8869c7672ca,It is impossible for a teacher to take all possible factors into account for each of their students to design a project that is compatible with their summer plans
8675,84fd3b46fd45,"By allowing students to design their own projects instead, each student can individually design their project in a way that is compatible with the existing summer plans."
8676,760e7318a87b,"some may argue that allowing students to design their own project encourages the design of lazy, easy, and uninspired projects."
8677,760e7318a87b,"After all, why would a student intentionally design a complex project for a time span intended to be a break?"
8678,dd274ffb07ad,"However, both teacher-designed and student-designed projects open up the possibility of lazy work."
8679,dd274ffb07ad,Teacher-designed projects will inevitably suffer from lazy work while student-designed projects can suffer from lazy design.
8680,dd274ffb07ad,"Either way, students will find ways to work less over their break"
8681,cd86b84cbb1f,"However, this assumes that students can design their project without supervision."
8682,cd86b84cbb1f,"By requiring teacher approval of a project, teachers can ensure that students design a project that is worth completing, while retaining all other benefits of a student-designed project."
8683,5533a49b9ee5,"While some may argue that student-designed projects will lead to lazy project design, this can be easily negated while also ensuring that students have an interesting project that they are able to complete over their break."
8684,5533a49b9ee5,"By allowing students to design their own projects, they can choose, for themselves, an interesting topic that they are interested in studying."
8685,5533a49b9ee5,They can also ensure that the completion of the project is possible within their own summer plans.
8686,5533a49b9ee5,Student-designed projects lead to project interest and completion more than any teacher-designed project ever could.
8687,5533a49b9ee5,"By having students design their own projects, it ensures a unique and interesting learning experience over their summer break."
8688,6037cab874ba,The author supports his idea by giving many examples towards the text.
8689,6037cab874ba,He provied enough support towards his idea.
8690,6037cab874ba,The idea of studying Venus is worthy despite the dangers.
8691,94a294546e67,With the information provied we can determind that the author gave enough reasons.
8692,94a294546e67,"For example ""These conditions are far more extreme than anything human encounter on Earth.""(para.3.)"
8693,54be3075341b,What its trying to tell us is that Venus is a planet in which in life is nothing close to ours.
8694,54be3075341b,The planet is buring hot due to the fact it's closer to the sun.
8695,54be3075341b,Explaining that life in Venus isn't possible human.
8696,973ae973099c,"Scientists take a big role, they are the ones that plan everything."
8697,973ae973099c,The amount of time and effort placed into their work determines if we get to travel to Venus.
8698,973ae973099c,"For example ""scientists seeking to conduct a through mission to understand Venus would need to get uo close and personal despit the risks.""(para.6.)"
8699,973ae973099c,"Getting up close and looking at the real thing there... standing in front of you, unsure on what to to do."
8700,30350649a9bf,"Everything around you looking brand new, thats what the scientists want,, To be able to look at the Venus in person, the authour supports this claim by supporting deatil."
8701,51382c6fbf51,"After reading the passage I am able to infer the main idea, which was the author supporting his idea of Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers."
8702,51382c6fbf51,"The infernace I was able to capture,""human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally imtimidating endeavors.""(para.8.)"
8703,51382c6fbf51,This paragraph gives us the idea of us humans.
8704,51382c6fbf51,"We could be told one millions times not to do somehting, but at the of the day we all end uo doing it like it or not."
8705,387665e219dd,Imagine you were forced to work on a topic you hated
8706,5ca2fa44c77a,Although it gives the students a chance to slack on the project
8707,3f347013eba9,i think students should be allowed to design their own projects
8708,de9d5af2c594,it gives them a chance to be creative
8709,0d34d304008f,it's something positive for them to do
8710,0cc2a77d9e50,they will always be learning.
8711,1797a9bb932b,The students have a chance to be creative and have fun with the project
8712,8fe7d9fe8697,It gives them an opportunity to pick something they really love learning about and it helps the teacher get to know them better.
8713,8fe7d9fe8697,They're most likely to put a lot more effort into the project.
8714,8fe7d9fe8697,"For example, you were just assigned a project and the topic on it was something you absolutely hated you're not going to want to do the project or put much effort in it and you're going to get bored with it."
8715,ff34c4a3f81a,It's something positive for students to do during the summer.
8716,40cc58765242,Kids are more likely to get into trouble whether it's because of boredom or they just like it them designing the project will give them something positive to do it'll keep them out of trouble and they'll have fun doing it.
8717,40cc58765242,"For example, one of the students i know likes to ride bikes everywhere even when he isn't allowed to and that gets him in a lot of trouble so one day i took him to the library and we read books and built action figures and he didn't get into any more trouble after that so sometimes all students need is something positive in their life and this project is just the thing they need."
8718,6b7b31f15788,The students will always be learning
8719,b896c7be3eb2,Them designing their own project is an amazing idea because it gives them the chance to be responsible and make desisons on their own.
8720,b896c7be3eb2,They would have to use their brain to create and complete the project all by themselves.
8721,b896c7be3eb2,Just because school is out doesn't mean the students stop learning the summer is all about growing and maturing and them creating their own project is a great way to start.
8722,b896c7be3eb2,"For example, one if my close friends won a price for one of her many great projects and she had to give a speech and in her speech she said "" This project has made more responsible and has taught me so much about myself and i hope i inspire everyone to go out and be creative."""
8723,bc0aca68ce4a,"This project is exactly what students need it helps them be creative, it gives them something positive to do, and they're always learning!"
8724,d3cdcc7a2778,Some people may think that the Face on Mars was made by aliens
8725,ae74700dea63,Today I am here to share with you that scientificly it is just a natural landform.
8726,54af0b453ce7,It is just a conspericy that the Face was made by aliens.
8727,54af0b453ce7,The Mars Global Surveyor captured photos of what the Face looks like from above Mars.
8728,54af0b453ce7,The image shows a landform on the planet that seems to look very much like a face.
8729,99e0e96708c1,The Face on Mars is scientificly known to be a landform in the planet.
8730,99e0e96708c1,This landform is much like the Martian equvialent of a butte or mesa.
8731,47f4e62cc485,The landform just so happens to look like a face.
8732,47f4e62cc485,That's why many people believe that the lanform is was actually made by aliens.
8733,47f4e62cc485,Do you know how there are craters on the moon?
8734,47f4e62cc485,"If so the ""Face"" is almost like that but instead of the crater going in, it's pushing outward."
8735,47f4e62cc485,That is the easiest way to describe it.
8736,34d72bdd5af9,So far NASA has not found aliens to be real.
8737,909a095474db,That doesn't meant that they aren't real.
8738,909a095474db,It just means that the face is highly unlikely to be made by aliens.
8739,909a095474db,"But one day if NASA does discover aliens that might be a possibility that the ""landform"" was made by aliens."
8740,909a095474db,But until that day comes around it will just be considered a landform based on scientific facts.
8741,70d8c3798e9d,The first spacecraft to see this landform was NASA's Viking 1 in 1976.
8742,70d8c3798e9d,"Then 18 years later, on April 5, 1998, the MGS flew over Cydonia for the first time."
8743,70d8c3798e9d,The picture that the MOC was 10 times sharper than the orginal Viking photos.
8744,70d8c3798e9d,This became very popular at that time in the past.
8745,70d8c3798e9d,"The Face was used in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, and radio talk shows."
8746,627f93a5bd45,These things started all the talk about the face being created by aliens.
8747,5461b1943fc9,So in all the Face was not made by aliens at all.
8748,5461b1943fc9,It just happens to be a natural landform in the shape of a face.
8749,5461b1943fc9,I can see where everyone got mistaken but the facts are that it was not made by aliens.
8750,5461b1943fc9,So now you will be able to say that you know a lot of things about the Face on Mars!
8751,5461b1943fc9,That is everything that I can explain to you about the Face on Mars.
8752,78cf32402520,Do you use your cell phone while driving?
8753,78cf32402520,More than half of car accidents that occur are caused by drivers who use their cell phone while driving.
8754,78cf32402520,Maybe you should think twice about using it while you are driving.
8755,78cf32402520,Drivers that put a hand on a cell phone while driving can cause them to get distracted and cause an accident.
8756,78cf32402520,The car accident can lead up to taking a human's life.
8757,2a0f1d1d568f,Even if the accident is not big it still could have been prevented by not using your cell phone.
8758,2f80189c0756,Car accidents are one of the main things that are caused by drivers who use their cell phones but it's not the only things that gets caused by using your phone while you're driving.
8759,41fd5f71cb92,Sometimes you might pull your phone out at a red light but you don't realize the light has turned green which means you're causing traffic.
8760,41fd5f71cb92,Traffic is something mostly every driver hates.
8761,41fd5f71cb92,What if the person behind you has somewhere important to be but thanks to you you're holding them back because you got distracted with your phone?
8762,41fd5f71cb92,If someone is calling you and you have your phone in your purse or somewhere else in the car you're going to get distracted trying to pull it out of where you have it.
8763,41fd5f71cb92,If you have Bluetooth on your car you should connect it so it's easier to answer the call without having to try pull your phone out of where it's at.
8764,41fd5f71cb92,"If you do not have Bluetooth, you should try putting your phone on do not disturb so that way you won't have the temptation to want to pull it out."
8765,41fd5f71cb92,Maybe even fully shut it down or just turn the sound off.
8766,3d4490c9204e,"Every day, every hour, every minute as we continue with our life's a car accident occurs due to someone using their phone."
8767,3d4490c9204e,Using your cell phone while driving is a big no.
8768,01183a34c70d,Phone calls are not the only thing that get you distracted while driving but you got to remember your social medias are blowing up which means you're getting a notification every here and there.
8769,025051b20b7d,Just knowing your friends texted you or someone posted / sent you something you'll most likely want to take a quick little glance at your phone but then that's going to want to make you use it for even longer which gets you distracted.
8770,025051b20b7d,Maybe you don't like what's on the radio so you want to use your aux to you can put a song you actually like if this does occur just wait till you're at red light but as soon as you're done doing that put it away you don't want to cause traffic.
8771,025051b20b7d,All of these things are ways your cell phone can get you distracted.
8772,6c3a54862c9e,Stop using your cell phones while the car is on drive.
8773,6c3a54862c9e,Think about the people who are walking around you and driving around you.
8774,6c3a54862c9e,What if there's a baby in the car?
8775,6c3a54862c9e,"Let's say you get in an accident you just hit someone's family think about what if that was your family who just got injured because you decided to pull out your phone, because you got distracted liking someone's new Instagram post, because you just had to take a selfie for snapchat."
8776,6c3a54862c9e,All of that could have waited till you got to your destination.
8777,6c3a54862c9e,Stop letting these little things get to you.
8778,6c3a54862c9e,"Now think about it was pulling your phone really worth it now you just hurt not only the family but yourself, your car is all distorted."
8779,b67fbc0d10e3,Everything that just happened could have been stopped if you only would have waited and not let your phone distract you.
8780,4cc477210410,Some people never realize how much a cell phone can actually cause.
8781,4cc477210410,This because some people never stop and think about their actions.
8782,b4074679af83,"Yes, your cell phone might be small"
8783,72cf6eafe786,but the impacts it can cause are huge.
8784,3e1be8801767,Next time you want to pull your cell phone out wait till you get to your destination because a phone call or message is not more important than your own life.
8785,3e1be8801767,"If someone important is calling your or texting just tell them, you were driving and they should be able to understand that."
8786,d37dfa6ee839,"A picture, song, video, etc."
8787,d37dfa6ee839,is not worth you getting yourself hurt or hurting someone else is not worth or even making some have a bad because you made them get stuck in traffic.
8788,d37dfa6ee839,Maybe you didn't even hurt yourself but you did hurt someone else just because you're ok doesn't mean you couldn't have hurt someone else bad.
8789,d37dfa6ee839,You need to get use to not having the urge to pull out your phone every time you get a notification.
8790,d37dfa6ee839,If you an emergency and you just have to use your phone pull over and park somewhere just don't pull it out and think you can multitask we you know you got to pay 100% attention to the road.
8791,7f82c5e6bfe7,In my own opinion I think that it is a bad idea to explore the habitat and enviroment of venus because the conditions just seem to unbareable but the author do make some good points on why we should explore it a little more.
8792,c770a25c0e74,"One reason the author wants to pursuit exploring venus is becasue it's the second planet from the sun and really close to earth its often referred to as Earth ""twin""."
8793,0745c8a39d0c,Long ago like hundreds or even millions of years ago venus have beeen the most earth like planet in our solar system.
8794,0745c8a39d0c,Venus have many and multiple things that are similar to earth for instance venus have rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys mountains and craters
8795,fd6642c76cea,I think the author have a good reason to keep studying venus it is earth like with all the similar features besided from the high carbon dioxide and extreme storms and weather temperatures.
8796,89d0e3cc063b,Humans have sent numerouse spacecraft to land on venus but none have survived for more than a few hours.
8797,89d0e3cc063b,Every since then not a single spacecraft have touched down on venus since more than three decades.
8798,89d0e3cc063b,Venus have a thick atmosphere of almost ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide.
8799,89d0e3cc063b,Venus temperatures is really extreme the temperature average eight hundred degrees on a regular.
8800,89d0e3cc063b,The pressure and atmosphere is ninety times greater then earth's atmosphere.
8801,fad79f7c49d2,Venus has the hottest temperature of any planet in our solar system even though mercury is closest to the sun.
8802,5f5fb0259e9f,This reason being is because of the weather conditions venus have erupting like valcanoes powerful earthquakes and frequent lighting strikes that hits the surface.
8803,5f5fb0259e9f,These conditions are far extreme then anything on earth.
8804,5f5fb0259e9f,The conditions on venus could crush a submarine accustomed for diving to the deepest parts of our ocean.
8805,5f5fb0259e9f,But still NASA is trying to figure out a way to send scientist to venus so they can study the palnet more.
8806,75c52c65a89b,Scientist say that venus could have been covered in with largely oceans and had life forms on its planet similar to earth
8807,f2c7a062bdb2,they say this because venus still have some features that are analogous to thoes on earth.
8808,f2c7a062bdb2,They say that sometimes venus can be our nearest option for a planetary visit.
8809,f2c7a062bdb2,Scientist is making a blimp like craft so that can float thirty miles above venus to study it better.
8810,f2c7a062bdb2,Scientist wants to find out how much venus is like earth and trying to see if it csn somehow be habital in them extreme conditions.
8811,58ae61c95bda,The only problem with everything thats going is that being above and studing the planet give you limited insight on the ground to see whats going on.
8812,58ae61c95bda,"More importantly researchers cannot researchsample of rock, gas or anything else from that distance in the air."

8826,68e75b3b45ed,It may take a long time to get there and back
8827,5b28e4e07769,hey its worth the wait to help the sick
8828,f5285ffcac59,You also get to explore new places around the world with me and my friend
8829,80b1f79454c9,it also gets you exercising because there is a lot of heavy things like the hay barrels.

8842,0f9673b1dbdc,A small strip of metal aalong the edge stopped my slide keeping me from flying overboard into the dark Antlantic.
8843,56293df98cff,I found time to have fun on board
8844,416ed7f0c0bd,The author suggests that studying Venus is important for a few reasons.
8845,b09da3f49c70,The first of which is that Venus is one of the most Earth like planets in our solar system.
8846,dedeff88be04,The second one is Venus could have once been able to be compatable for life.
8847,9336a75c2622,Another thing that the author brings up is that Venus has powerful earthquakes and frequent lightning strikes.
8848,9e378fe2d88a,The final reason is that the author brings up the challenges that NASA is facing in trying to get to Venus.
8849,c281cb29ef81,What the author is getting to is that when we finally figure out how to get to Venus this could help us get to other planets as well.
8850,c281cb29ef81,That is why I think that the author wants us to study Venus.
8851,e9f5a044244d,Venus has a rocky surface similar to that of Earth's.
8852,e9f5a044244d,"It also has valleys, mountain, and craters all of this is similar to that of Earth's and can be used to maybe help us more understand out planet."
8853,e9f5a044244d,Another thing that the author brings up is that Venus is similar to Earth is that scientist believe that Venus was once covered largely with oceans.
8854,e9f5a044244d,This means that their could have been life on Venus such as plants.
8855,7b0bfe2d8b94,this is something that we also share with that is also happening here on Earth.
8856,7b0bfe2d8b94,If we could go to Venus and study all of that it could help us understand how to know farther ahead of time when we may have a a earthquake.
8857,b1d2fbd4f63b,The troubles that we face is the atmosphere and the pressure.
8858,b1d2fbd4f63b,These challenges make it almost impossibe for humans to withstand becase the pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience here on Earth.
8859,b1d2fbd4f63b,"So what the author is getting at is that if we are able to get through all of these challenges and get boots on the ground on Venus, it would mean that when we are to explore or study another planet we can overcome these challenges much faster."
8860,da37345c71fa,So that is why I think that the author wants us to explore Venus.
8861,da37345c71fa,The first reason being Venus is one of the most Earth like planets in our solar system.
8862,da37345c71fa,The second one being that Venus was once able to be compatable for life.
8863,da37345c71fa,Third is that Venus experiences earthquakes and lightning striks just like Earth does.
8864,da37345c71fa,Finally the last thing that the author brings up is that going to Venus could help us travel to other planets with knowledge on how we can overcome the challenges from Venus.
8865,da37345c71fa,That is why I think that the author wants NASA to study Venus farther and learn more about it.
8866,e8ec84557228,There is a new software the has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of other.
8867,e8ec84557228,The Facial Action Coding System.
8868,e8ec84557228,They put a imagine of Mona Lisa Smile.
8869,e8ec84557228,In the applications called FACS knows how she is like how happy you are or angry.
8870,e8ec84557228,"But with her they got a 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguested, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."
8871,e8ec84557228,In the software is the latest innovation from prof.
8872,e8ec84557228,"There is Thomas Huang, of the beckman institute for Advanced Science at the University of illinois, working in collaboration with prof. Also they actually calculate emotions like math homework and how a computer recognize the subtle facial movements we humans use to express , and how we feel."
8873,e8ec84557228,The computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the faces.
8874,e8ec84557228,"And the facil expressions for each emotion are universal, observes Dr. Huang."
8875,e8ec84557228,Even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression like not smiling as broadly.
8876,e8ec84557228,"With Mona Lisa demonstration is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much the computer can do."
8877,e8ec84557228,"They are 3 things while you are looking in the mirror 1 is raise your lips at the comers of your mouth, 2 is squinting yours eyes slightly, to produce wrinkling at the comers of your eyes and 3 is holding that raise the outer parts of your cheeks up."
8878,e8ec84557228,Towars your eyes.
8879,e8ec84557228,"The facial feedback theory of emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them."
8880,e8ec84557228,Empathy feeling someone else's emotional state may happen because we unconsciously imitate another person's facial expressions.
8881,e8ec84557228,All that is about science or technology.
8882,318db62cd1aa,I think the application is smart because it show's you how you are in the moment.
8883,91922ab6fbed,The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the danger it presents
8884,72009ac52fcb,they have tried to explore Venus for many years and they can't succed
8885,a81a7c00e4e3,"because only they can stay there for a couple of hours before they can't be out on venus anymore however they do have a nickname for Venus it is called the ""Evening Star"" and why they named it that because it is one of the brightest point of light in the night sky but they said that nickname was misleading because Venus was a actual planet in our solar sytem and Venus was simple to see from a distance but it is a safe vantage point from it said that it was proven a very challenging palce to examine more closely but they often reffered Venus as earths twin because Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size and it is occasionally the closest in distance too."
8886,a81a7c00e4e3,"But striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself , but also because human curiosity it will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."
8887,a81a7c00e4e3,And our travels on earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.
8888,a81a7c00e4e3,But the reason why Venus is not good to explore because almost 97% of carbon dioxide blankets is covered all over Venus and on the planets surface it is about 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.
8889,ee6e21cb6a0b,"Driving can be extremely dangerous for you or anyone else, especially if you're not careful and focused."
8890,ee6e21cb6a0b,While driving you must be sure that your taking every precaution you can to maintain safety for yourself and others as well.
8891,ee6e21cb6a0b,"Many people believe that the use of cell phones can be very hazardous, and I strongly agree with that statement for many reasons."
8892,ee6e21cb6a0b,Cell phones have caused fatal wrecks that lead to either death or serious injury.
8893,ee6e21cb6a0b,"For example, ""an article published by Tony Long states that he was almost killed on his motorcycle while trying to avoid being hit by a reckless driver who was on the phone."""
8894,cbcb5b556493,The use of cell phones while operating a vehicle isn't the most ideal or realistic to ensure your safety as well as others safety.
8895,46e557ff99fe,"Cell phones cause late reactions, especially for those that are being held in the driver's hand."
8896,732ced766cb5,Majority of people have a habit of allowing their cell phone to influence their reflexes and reactions to certain death-defying situations.
8897,732ced766cb5,"One of my resources states, ""Not only are 27 percent of all automobile accidents believed to result from talking or texting while driving, but smartphone use has also been implicated in several recent rail disasters as well."""
8898,732ced766cb5,"The use of cell phones while driving a vehicle is just as dangerous as drunk driving, maybe even worse because studies shown that, ""texting and driving slows the reaction time more than being drunk""."
8899,732ced766cb5,"Meaning that using a phone while under the wheel can alter a driver's reaction time on the road because your focusing on two things at once, although all your attention should be towards driving and driving only."
8900,a55d6db6c7e7,Even a two-second distraction - taking your eyes off the road to pick up your phone and see who's calling you for example- increases your risk of crashing
8901,405d266a8620,"The National Safety Council reports that, ""answering a text takes away your attention for about five seconds."

8903,405d266a8620,"Anything can happen while you're driving, such as: a car could hit their brakes in front of you, a car could be merging into your lane, traffic might be coming up, or something might jump out into the road."
8904,405d266a8620,"Therefore, you need to keep your eyes on the road at all times with your hands free of anything other than the steering wheel."
8905,dfa0a44f1fce,"It is statistically proven that the cell phone use while driving leads to 1.6 million crashes with nearly 390,000 injuries each year."
8906,9cafdc586552,"Even with those high numbers, people still choose to be on a cell phone while managing with a vehicle on the road."
8907,9cafdc586552,"Some people believe that it is safe to use a phone while driving, or that ""nothing will happen to them"""
8908,4bfc94e53cca,"In 2017, there were 34,247 distracted driving accidents and 15,341 that were aged between 15 and 29 were involved in fatal crashes while driving with a cell phone in hand."
8909,4bfc94e53cca,"Therefore, some people may believe that using a cell phone while driving isn't dangerous, but the facts say otherwise."
8910,fe1c4b503f75,"In conclusion, don't operate a vehicle while using a phone at the same time because it can lead to some serious consequences."
8911,fe1c4b503f75,"You are not only endangering yourself but your endangering others on the road, as well as passengers, or even any close-by pedestrians."
8912,fe1c4b503f75,Driving needs complete attention and focus so ensure the risk of any injuries or deaths because driving is very dangerous.
8913,fe1c4b503f75,Using a cell phone takes away your focus and attention from driving because now you're trying to multi-task which means you're playing with life or lives.
8914,fe1c4b503f75,"Speaking from experience, cell phones should be banned while driving because they slow your reaction time to anything that may be happening around you."
8915,fe1c4b503f75,Managing a cell phone while driving is now putting you in a life or death situation that you wouldn't want to be put in.
8916,70d5070fd74d,Do you think cellphones should be used while driving?
8917,70d5070fd74d,Using your phone is the top ten ways of accidents
8918,95eefd54ca61,I don't think you should use your cell phone while driving because it is very dangerous to you and other cars.
8919,a43422c47c3c,"You can look down for 10-15 seconds then look ""BOOM"" it's a crash."
8920,a43422c47c3c,That should be one of the least ways you want to die even though it's not always your fault.
8921,a900dccf538b,"Using a cell phone is a big distraction, not only to you but to others to."
8922,fd42b027b361,Everyone has to pay attention to the road just like you will have to.
8923,fd42b027b361,"It can cause you to swerve; stop on brakes to hard, not pay attention to your surroundings, and last but you least it will cause a wreck."
8924,fd42b027b361,You can put others in dangers from your use to the road.
8925,40576dcc6b55,"Having 4 mirrors in total is the reason for a car, without mirrors you will be driving and have nothing to look forward to and also backwards."
8926,8f9ed721eda7,Looking forward is the way to go because if you keep looking at what's beside you and behind you will cause a lot of commotion in traffic.
8927,8f9ed721eda7,If that can cause commotion imagine what looking down at your cell phone can do and what trouble it can put you in.
8928,85396c477afc,Explaining all this to the police is a big mess when the situation can be resolved by just focusing on the road and what's in front of you.
8929,b5411bdb24fd,More importantly is your life and you staying alive.
8930,b5411bdb24fd,If you need your GPS to get somewhere its best you buy a phone holder to hold the phone up on your window or just buy a GPS from a nearby store.
8931,11bf1ebac895,"In conclusion, stay off your phone!"
8932,11bf1ebac895,It's a trend now not only to you but to the whole world.
8933,11bf1ebac895,It's impossible to do 2 things at one time while you control a steering wheel.
8934,11bf1ebac895,You can take innocent lives fin a matter of seconds for a message or phone call that could have waited.
8935,11bf1ebac895,If texting or being on the phone is more important just pull over.
8936,4c91ea9df6b9,"Making technology that can identify human emotions would be important, but not very much in everyday use"
8937,e34318191d6a,"If a student were not able to identify their emotions when seeing a therapist or school counsoler, then this device would work best their specifically because therapists/counsolers are trained to help with humans and their emotions."
8938,3ab3f00d4553,Let's say that students are in a class to learn about psychology or somethig of the sort.
8939,3ab3f00d4553,It would be very useful to find out what a person is feeling down to the percent.
8940,ec064827c057,This device would also be helpful there because it tells you about the muscles that move to show a certain emotion.
8941,ec064827c057,"'For example, your frontalis pars lateralis muscle (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when surprised...' (D'Alto paragraph 3); students can study their muscles that make their emotions by learning about these muscles."
8942,ae4d7dafe2d4,"In paragraph 9, it states '...Theory of Emotion, moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but also may even help produce them'"
8943,f65c6b1f665f,"Just by making faces and using this technology, students can learn so so much more about their emotions on a deep level that can help in many ways."
8944,f65c6b1f665f,"It would benefit students, teachers, therapists, and more."
8945,cf28d9d6b540,"In conclusion, this device and technology can help many different people in many ways."
8946,cf28d9d6b540,"Students can learn about their facial muslces, therapists can help their clients learn to identify what emotions they are feeling, parents can hep understand how their children are feeling, etc etc."
8947,cf28d9d6b540,Students can even help one another feel better in small classroom situatioins all together.
8948,fe972f250622,"In the first paragraph, the first sentence kind of threw me off a little bit, because when you say it like the paragraph did then it makes it sound bad knowing other people emotions."
8949,dfc184f87a2a,"I was sad or upset, and I was trying to hide it,

I wouldnt want other people knowing it."
8950,673af478c077,"Say I was at a family dinner and something happened, then I wouldn't want the rest of my family knowing that I am upset."
8951,c291922b06ce,"Yes, some of the arguments in the article can be good like, "" a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored."""
8952,12f279ba9974,Thats great but honestly I dont think this would be the best thing in the world.
8953,edda8f48703b,"The article asks us ""Does your exspression in the mirror suggest an emotion?"""
8954,edda8f48703b,"Of course it does, just sometimes we may not know what kind of emotion it is."
8955,edda8f48703b,Sometimes you may not be able to tell it on your face but you can definitely feel it.
8956,7a8d72a3761a,"Other people do not need to know what is wrong with you, rather you are upset, sad, angry or happy."
8957,faa0e84616ab,"If you have a smile on your face, thats great, the other person thinks your happy even if you arnt."
8958,faa0e84616ab,"If I want someone knowing what I am feeling, I am going to tell them."
8959,faa0e84616ab,I dont just want them or some computer reading my muscles in my face and telling me what emotion I am feeling.
8960,affff3291563,Technology these days are getting to be way to much.
8961,2e106335c868,Kids don't need to be told by a computer.
8962,2e106335c868,"""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" Dr. Huang predicts."
8963,2e106335c868,"""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."""
8964,9718835d2ee2,"What if the computer messes up the facial exspression and does something ""different"" to try to ""help"" that kid, but honestly the computer detected the wrong facial exspression and changed the lesson for the kid, when he really understood it."
8965,787234fc7a87,This is why I dont think this is such a good idea
8966,9cb401eca2c6,because sooner or later computers and technology are going to be running the world and later need updated or something and mess evereything up for our upcoming generations.
8967,43730706a3c3,If you thimk it is a alien civilisation you are mistaken.
8968,825127b183f4,If you think it is where is the evadence like houses
8969,4461ce1615df,It can be an astriod hiting the earth or it could very well be a mountain like we have on earth.
8970,4461ce1615df,Another thing i think it could be is an un earupted valcanneo like an other thing we have on earth.
8971,4461ce1615df,Also it can be where the inside of the planit has bin pushed out to cause a natural land form.
8972,4461ce1615df,There can also be other things it can be
8973,38a952bf72e0,The people that think that it is an alien civilisation they have to back there rason up with a lot of information and very detaild information to get me on there side.
8974,38a952bf72e0,Even then I probibly wont believe them it would have to be a very low chance i would take there side.

8989,e2025b6c0cd4,I wonder how many people were amazed by this news!
8990,fd9788e840b4,"In the article it states""Scientists figured it was just another maratian mesa, common enough around Cydonia, only this one had unusual shadows that made it look like an Egyptian Pharaoh."""

8999,c97d3f02646d,I think this face is a natural landform.
9000,707c8608453e,In conclusion some people believe it is natural and some don't.
9001,707c8608453e,People weren't the only one who thought it was life so did some scientists.
9002,707c8608453e,The other scientists say it was a normal thing on Mars.

9005,ebac86bd7c95,"People are facinated with the Man on the Moon and the idea of Martians, but most people do not think about life on Venus."
9006,ebac86bd7c95,Venus is the second planet from the sun and shares many geographical features with Earth.
9007,ebac86bd7c95,"However, studying this planet is made difficult by the dense and toxic atmosphere, high temperatures, and violent weather."
9008,ebac86bd7c95,"Despite this, some people think that Venus should still be explored, and the author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" is of this opinion."
9009,e259debf64f8,The idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is well supported by the author as seen through the rewards of studying Venus and the progress that has been made towards studying Venus.
9010,6b401b99ada1,"First, the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is well supported by the author as seen through the many rewards of studying Venus"
9011,b36af944417e,"After laying out the dangers of studying Venus, the author explains why scientists continue to study the planet."
9012,b36af944417e,"""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system"" (4)."
9013,b36af944417e,"By studying Venus, astronomers and geologists can predict what might happen to Earth in the future."
9014,b36af944417e,Gaining an understanding of Earth's future may well allow scientists to predict what happened in Earth's past.
9015,b36af944417e,"Scientists are eager to learn about the early years of Earth's past, as it is shrouded in mystery, and this thirst for knowledge motivates them to study Venus."
9016,b36af944417e,"In describing how similar Venus was to Earth, the author says, ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life"" (4)."
9017,b36af944417e,"If there was once life on Venus, the similarity between it and Earth would grow."
9018,b36af944417e,"As with geology, if biologists can understand what caused life to cease on Venus, they might be able to predict how life on Venus and on Earth might have started."
9019,b36af944417e,The author shows that scientists studying Venus reap the reward of being able to learn about Earth's geology and early life.
9020,b36af944417e,"By laying out the various rewards to be had from studying Venus, the author is strengthening his or her argument that Venus should be studied."
9021,2ed9325d1ad0,"Secondly, the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers is well supported by the author as seen through the large amount of progress that has been made towards studying Venus"
9022,f44ab4b052c6,"Although the author describes how Venus could be studied from the air, scientists still desire to learn about Venus from the planet's surface."
9023,f44ab4b052c6,One of their solutions to the problem of getting equipment to last on the surface of Venus is to expirement with new materials.
9024,f44ab4b052c6,"""Simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the choas of Venus's surface and have lasted of three weeks in such conditions"" (7)."
9025,f44ab4b052c6,Research and experimentation taking place on Earth is giving scientists and astronauts more options for studying Venus.
9026,f44ab4b052c6,"Although conditions on Venus are not hospitable to life, these new scientific advances are making it possible for data-gathering equipment to be sent to the surface of Venus and last long enough to gather data."
9027,f44ab4b052c6,Other scientists are moving away from traditional electronics and looking into purely mechanical systems.
9028,f44ab4b052c6,"""Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces"" (7)."
9029,f44ab4b052c6,"The alternative that has presented itself to would-be explorers of Venus is older technology, like that found in the earliest computers."
9030,f44ab4b052c6,Scientists have realized that modern technology is too fragile and that more durable technologies are needed.
9031,f44ab4b052c6,"By turning to other forms of technology, scientists are widening their options for ways to study Venus."
9032,f44ab4b052c6,"The author mentions three different ways that scientists are making progress towards being able to study Venus - from the air, using new materials, and using old technologies."
9033,f44ab4b052c6,The author's postion that Venus should continue to be studied is supported by the scientific advancements that are serving to make studying Venus a reality.
9034,3807d1eb96e2,"In conclusion, the author's opinon that Venus should continue to be studied despite the dangers is well supported by the rewards of studying another Earth-like planet and the advancements that have been made towards being able to effectively study Venus."
9035,3807d1eb96e2,"Scientists have strong motivation for studying Venus, and new technologies are making it possible for them to overcome the challenges presented by Venus's harsh terrain."
9036,3807d1eb96e2,"Although scientists studying Venus are unlikely to encounter any life forms, what they do discover will help them to understand Earth's past and shape our future."
9037,b42c0f54dff2,According to the passage using emotions and expression to show how we feel and animated characters using animations and showing facial expressions to express emotions and how they feel towards other things is not a bad idea.
9038,c72ed2ca0ac8,If a human gets hurt then the emotion and the expression would be squinting there eyes being loud or holding whatever got hurt.
9039,e25d32593785,So giving those types of animations and expressions to robots and video game characters would be good because you would not be able to tell what happened to them if they didnt have any emotion of when they got hurt or smiling.
9040,e25d32593785,When a human is taing a picture and you want to make it look nice they would smile so they would open there mouth and show there teeth making there face wrinkle.
9041,e25d32593785,They need to put the same emotion and such for animated characters in tv shows and video games.
9042,e25d32593785,"Also you have to use some muscles to smile and to show facial expressions towards everything like jobs,school,and even taking pictures."

9047,1c102c33472f,The face was on mars.
9048,1c102c33472f,The face was a pop Icon.
9049,1c102c33472f,The evidence I have that it says that it was in Movies books Haunted grocery store.
9050,1c102c33472f,Thatfor I know it is a pop Icon.
9051,1c102c33472f,To Mars because nothing ever has been found on Mars because it is super hot to do anything on it and ut is made out of sand.
9052,1c102c33472f,So that for I know the face was there before the aliens found it.
9053,1c102c33472f,The Face was on mars because the title of the article is Unmasking the Face on Mars.
9054,1c102c33472f,If you read the Article you would now that.
9055,1c102c33472f,The face is important to Mars and to the scientist Becaus e this is the fist thing found on Mars.
9056,1c102c33472f,The Face will Stay on Mars as long as it does not get damaged some how or disform
9057,8daed8a223dc,I conclued that the face will be there forever and ever.
9058,8daed8a223dc,The Aliens did not fine the face.
9059,8daed8a223dc,I am so mad that the you think that the aliens found the face but they did not The scientist found it so think again because if the Aliens did found out that they did find it then we should say sorry to the Aliens for thinking that we found it.
9060,8daed8a223dc,I say That we should discuss with our own sicentist to find out who found the face on mars.

9065,0e28c4a0535e,The Seagoing Cowboys program is a fun experience in many ways.
9066,288539e9c727,One way is all the places that you travel to.
9067,288539e9c727,"I have seen many landmarks, such as the Acropolis in Greece, Venice, Italy, and I also have been through the Panama Canal on my way to China."
9068,288539e9c727,"Also it is a fun experience after the animals had to be unloaded, we all played baseball and volleyball games where the animals had been housed."
9069,288539e9c727,"Also there would be table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, and many more fun activities."
9070,288539e9c727,Those were all some ways we had a fun experience during the program.
9071,2a6d0d7ce387,"Our program also takes care of animals, but that can also be fun in many ways."
9072,8dbfc1b19565,One way is that it can keep you busy is when you are caring for the animals during crossing.
9073,8dbfc1b19565,They have to be fed and watered three times a day.
9074,8dbfc1b19565,What helped me prepare for hard work was when I would help on my Aunt Katie's farm as a boy.
9075,8dbfc1b19565,"Also I would serve as a night watchmen, which meant I had to check on the animals every night."
9076,8dbfc1b19565,Once I almost died doing that job one rainy night.
9077,8dbfc1b19565,"As you can see, taking care of animals can be hard but also fun here at Seagoing Cowboys program."
9078,75ede427822e,My favorite part was traveling to many countries and all the beautiful sights.
9079,be51927cce4a,I have gotten to see Europe and China during our journies.
9080,be51927cce4a,Cattle boat trips were an unbelievable opportunity for a small-town boy.
9081,be51927cce4a,"I have also toured an excavated castle in Crete, and have been on a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, the city with streets of water."
9082,be51927cce4a,"As you can see in the first paragraph, where it also shows I have been to many other places."
9083,be51927cce4a,"In conlusion, you can see that traveling a one of the most fun parts of beingin the Seagoing Cowboys program."
9084,eb4169db8761,"Throughout the whole story, you can see that in the Seagoing Cowboys program, it is a fun experience, it helps animals, and you get to travel a whole lot."

9102,643277623c55,"New technology is being introduced to mankind almost every second in this world, and now, the latest techonology is a computer program called the Facial Action Coding System which can identify a person's emotions."
9103,643277623c55,The question is whether this technology is actually valuable and for what it could be used for.
9104,643277623c55,Experts suggest this technology could be used in a classroom to identify the state of mind of a student to adjust the lesson they are trying to comprehend.
9105,643277623c55,"But, even though this technology may be helpful to teachers trying to keep students active and engrossed in their lessons, the question arises of whether this techonlogy is actually worth the recources or whether what experts think is a great idea is actually an invasion of privacy."
9106,f315ff556868,This technology does sound helpful in the fact that it could gauge the state of mind of a student and help a teacher adjust their teaching methods to accomodate and keep their students students on track.
9107,7a3aef0cfc2d,"The article did state that the techonology could identify when a student is ""confused or bored"" and then ""modify the lesson"" to keep a student engaged."
9108,7a3aef0cfc2d,"In this way, the technology is useful in the fact that it adapts to the needs of the student."
9109,09cc9d107416,But what can this program do that a teacher's survey could not?
9110,13290ff2b629,"By the way the article talks about how a ""home PC can't handle the complex algorithms"" and about how complex the system is, it makes people wonder just how much this system would cost and how complicated it would be to enstate said system into a classroom."
9111,13290ff2b629,"Compared to a quick survey done by a teacher who asks their students how they feel about their methods of teaching, it is seen how the system would be a waste of recourses and money."
9112,5afd333e5272,"Therefore, although this system is useful in the fact that it can gauge the emotions of the students, it is not much more useful than a teacher who can do the same thing by questioning their students on their preferences and ideas."
9113,6d33cf99b668,"Also, although technology is very much improved in these years, it is still not always accurate and infallible, and therefore may not be suitable for a classroom."
9114,8fea1988dd01,"The article states that the technology associates each emotion with ""characteristic movements of the facial muscles"" and then uses those movements to calculate the spectrum of emotions based on their facial display."
9115,8fea1988dd01,"But some people show emotions in various ways, and the technology most likely cannot accomodate for the many different ways people express the same emotion."
9116,8fea1988dd01,"For example, if a student has a resting face that seems generally happy, the system might confuse this dazed face as a satisfied face and think that the student is happy with their lessons when they are actually confused or not paying attention."
9117,8fea1988dd01,"In the same way, if a student has a resting face that looks naturally sad, the system may think they are unhappy with their lessons, even if the student feels they are learning a lot."
9118,8fea1988dd01,"A lot of students also try to hide their emotions, like frusteration or sadness, with a happier look on their face, and even though the article states that the system can detect a ""false smile"", it cannot always be accurate as a person may be good at hiding their emotions and displaying a genuine smile."
9119,8fea1988dd01,"Therefore, since technology is not always accurate and because human beings are so various in the way they behave, the technology would not be useful in a classroom where it may misread a student's state of mind and lead them in the wrong path of education."
9120,e1c403d5961a,"Lastly, if the physical problems of the technology have not already been offputting, then maybe the moral problem of this technology will sway opinions against using it in a classroom."
9121,e1c403d5961a,"If this technology really can ""indicate the difference between a genuine smile and a forced one"", then this means it can invade people's privacy and indicate an emotion which a person is trying to hide."
9122,f2279f75a610,"If a student is feeling sad or feeling stressed about home problems which they are trying to conceal, then the technology detects this and displays it for the teacher and the electronic lesson to see."
9123,f2279f75a610,"This is an invasion of privacy, as the teacher does not need to know about a student's homelife or about their feelings outside the classroom."
9124,f2279f75a610,"A teachers job should be to monitor how their students are feeling about their lessons, not about how their students are feeling about their life outside of school, and since this technology could pick up on digressing feelings, it should not be used in a classroom where a student's internal feelings are revealed to a teacher."
9125,f2279f75a610,"Therefore, using Facial Action Coding could end up being an invasion of privacy that should not be introduced to the classroom."
9126,8718827d6432,"The Facial Action Coding System is a bad idea for the classroom, as it could incorrectly read a student's emotions and give a misleading output that puts a student off track in their education, and also because it could invade a student's privacy of their inner mind."
9127,b6f2399dd42b,"Therefore, installing this system in schools would be a waste of money and recourses, especially when teachers can gauge how their students are learning by simply asking their students in an anonymous survey how they feel about their teaching methods."
9128,b6f2399dd42b,"In this society, technology is used to fix almost everything, but in this case, scientists should quit trying to force technology on behavioral issues and just let humans interact so they can benefit themselves with communication, no computerized middleman needed."

9130,d192d3899bd4,venus is one of the most challenging planets but on the pther hand venus has struck the curasidity of many people

9133,5ca188b62fd0,leaving the abillity to go venture very dangerous.
9134,5ca188b62fd0,venus can have an atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide which can be very harmful to humans along with the fact that it is 800 degrees Fahrenheit.
9135,b9b04e157193,its hard but worth it to find out what we can on venus
9136,bc239e60a87c,and be aus eof this NASA hasnt given up yet trying to figure out ways to safely travel there and back.
9137,18ce88fd5d28,Can you see the emotions in the Mona Lisa?
9138,18ce88fd5d28,A latest technology that can recognize emotions was the latest innovation from Prof.
9139,18ce88fd5d28,"This technology claims it has the ability to read every emotion, even in pictures."
9140,18ce88fd5d28,Is this a reliable technology or is this something that isnt exact?
9141,b8eb2959d607,"The recent technology on seeing emotions talks about how the Mona Lisa is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disguested, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."
9142,b8eb2959d607,How can we know if this is true because we were not there to tell what her emotions where.
9143,b8eb2959d607,"Yes you can see some emotion in her painting, because it states that Da Vinci studied the human anatomy so that it would help him with painting facial muslces precisely to show emotion."
9144,33b704cfda3f,This technology can be good for some purposes.
9145,33b704cfda3f,"Dr. Huang makes a statement saying, ""A classroom computer could tell when a student is becoming confused or bored, then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human structor."""
9146,8cc71dc442c6,"This is a good factor, because this can help students with school so theyre not falling behind."
9147,115f0321bc55,"Overall this technology may have some pros, and it has some cons."
9148,234e77e0193c,If you put it to good use like for instince helping kids when theyre confused or bored it will show them other ways which is good.
9149,888f4cfc95a3,Then you have your cons.
9150,888f4cfc95a3,This technology might not always be precise and at some point this could lead to problems when trying to solve a serious situation.
9151,0af51a3bc096,"This technology is realiable at some points, theyre are multiple ways it can help and then there can be some disfunctions."
9152,0af51a3bc096,Every technology has their flaws though.
9153,94ffafd00f2c,"So picture you're at home, burdened with homework, rushing to get it all done and all of a sudden, your parent gets an email from the school saying that every student will have to take one extracurricular activity."
9154,94ffafd00f2c,"Your parents are worried because extracurricular activities are expensive, how you'll get to and from that activity, and your school work."
9155,94ffafd00f2c,How fair is that?
9156,94ffafd00f2c,It puts stress on you and your family.
9157,c8c4a94e84c6,"extracurricular activities are great for growing teenagers, it can be a great safe space for them,"
9158,990b8d73bc29,but why should they be forced to take one?
9159,e4dc69cb34b8,They Are Really Expensive
9160,8eae3945999f,"Some popular activities are dance, martial arts, sports, and music."
9161,8eae3945999f,Which are all VERY expensive.
9162,8eae3945999f,"They are great extracurricular activities to do, but so expensive, and not all parents can afford them."
9163,8eae3945999f,"For dance, costumes are at least $100, dance shoes vary on quality, but are usually expensive, dance wear is about $30-$50 per piece, and makeup, lots and lots of makeup."
9164,8eae3945999f,"Plus, you usually have to know how to sew, and if you don't already, you might have to add the expense of sewing classes in there."
9165,8eae3945999f,See how they all add up?
9166,8eae3945999f,"That's about $230 for just costumes, dance wear and shoes."
9167,8eae3945999f,"Let's say your parent is a teacher, the average teacher makes $65,000 per year which isn't that much."
9168,8eae3945999f,"Some even make $35,000 per year, even less."
9169,8eae3945999f,"And to have school expenses, plus that, that's a huge chunk of your parent's paycheck."
9170,8eae3945999f,"Some parents have to use that money to pay rent or mortgage, heating bills, water bills, electricity bills, and extra things like clothes, and food."
9171,8eae3945999f,That doesn't give them that much of a flexible amount to spend.
9172,8eae3945999f,"Some kids prefer to save their parent's money, plus if they dont want to take one, that's even more unfair."
9173,d3eda3cbb7d0,They Won't Be Committed To It
9174,8bc14a01bda0,"Let's say the options the school provides are all not of interest to them, so they're forced to take something they don't want to do."
9175,8bc14a01bda0,How would you like to be forced to commit to something you didn't want to do to start with?
9176,8bc14a01bda0,I'm pretty sure no one would want that.
9177,8bc14a01bda0,"Though extracurricular activities are great for students to do, some are just reserved and are shy when having to do things in front of people."
9178,8bc14a01bda0,"For students with anxiety, that is extremely embarrassing."
9179,8bc14a01bda0,"Plus, if you force someone to do something they don't want to do, they'll just do it with half-effort and that makes everything one step harder for the people who actually wanted to do that activity."
9180,8bc14a01bda0,"I can almost guarantee that this will happen if schools force students to do this, and it'll just make the activities less fun for the ones who actually want to do it."
9181,970b8ad00de4,They May Have Other Things To Do
9182,cbec4bb51010,"in middle school, there's a lot of homework, even more so in high school."
9183,cbec4bb51010,A lesson is usually about an hour and a half long.
9184,cbec4bb51010,"School ends at 3:30, so they'd get home at 5:00."
9185,cbec4bb51010,"5 or 6 is the most common dinner time, and it usually lasts about 30 minutes."
9186,cbec4bb51010,That's 5:30.
9187,cbec4bb51010,"Then, they have to go and try to finish their homework."
9188,cbec4bb51010,"If they have a lot of it, it can take a long time, and can usually lead to them putting off important stuff, like personal hygiene (GROSS!)."
9189,cbec4bb51010,"They're probably super exhausted from their activity, and just want to take a shower."
9190,cbec4bb51010,"But nope, they have to do the rest of their homework."
9191,cbec4bb51010,"Depending on how much they have, they could end up staying up really late."
9192,cbec4bb51010,Highschoolers can usually end up staying up until 3 am in the morning doing homework.
9193,cbec4bb51010,That makes them more tired and not ready to focus the next day.
9194,cbec4bb51010,It could've saved them so much more if they didn't have to do the activity.
9195,e2a9e5180d3d,"I feel like if schools force students to do an extracurricular activity, they will see lower test grades, lower participation rates, much more attitudes towards them, and more tardiness."
9196,e2a9e5180d3d,"This behavioral change will be because of the time wasted on things they don't want to do, and less sleeping hours."
9197,5e4eb879a48e,"Though extracurricular activities are great for them, dont force them on people, because instead of helping, it's actually hurting."
9198,e38624c89155,This article starts out by telling the audience about all of the pros and cons of Venus.
9199,e38624c89155,"The first thing is mentions is how at some times we are so close to it that many people think it is a star, and it talks about how humans on Earth can easily see it at a safe distance, but it is very difficult to get close to."
9200,e38624c89155,Venus is the cloest planet to Earth's density and size.
9201,1e981180665a,"The author explains how he thinks that it is a worthy cause to try to explore venus, even though we have never successfuly landed a spacecraft there for more than a few hours."
9202,00810a985912,The author does very well arguing his or her point.
9203,4bdfaea3ffdc,"I agree with the author, I think he or she made some very well stated points about why humans should work everyday to get closer and closer to Venus."
9204,4bdfaea3ffdc,"There are many arguing points as to why poeple would think that it is good or bad to try to send spacecrafts, let alone humans, to Venus."
9205,a1b47db7630e,"Starting out with the dissadvantages,"
9206,615dddd4a5dc,"the planet's surface is over 800 degrees, obviously not suitable for humans, or any life force for that matter, to survive."
9207,615dddd4a5dc,"Venus has a hotter surface temperature than any other planet in our solar system, even though Mercury is closer to our sun, due to the atmosphere made up of almsot 97 percent carbon."
9208,d77db29de2ae,"These facts sound misserible so far, but if there was a way that humans could figure out how to land on Venus safely, and maybe even start a civilization there, that would be groundbreaking."
9209,38418e5b9404,"The author backs up his or her point by saying how ""Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earth-like planet in our solar system."
9210,38418e5b9404,"Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."""
9211,38418e5b9404,The fact that at one time Venus might have been covered in water has convienced me that there is some sort of way to create life there.
9212,38418e5b9404,"Not only does he or she mention how Venus might have once been covered in water, but also informs the audience that Venus has many Earth-like structures."
9213,38418e5b9404,"Venus is made up of mountians, valleys, and craters."
9214,3f0ef2bf46c5,"The author does a very good job describing and pin-pointing all of the detailed needed to convience someone to beilve in life on Venus, and support sending probes and eventually humans out to discover Venus."
9215,3f0ef2bf46c5,"The authors talks about how hard it would be for a mission to Venus to be both safe and productive, but he or she also talks about how much we would gain from it."
9216,3f0ef2bf46c5,"The author shows how floating in a blimp, 30 miles above the surface would be almost suitable for humans to survive, at 170 degrees."
9217,3f0ef2bf46c5,"The article says that ""Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to our knowledge of Venus."""
9218,3f0ef2bf46c5,One day humans will be able to land a spacecraft on Venus long enogh to collect information about the planets past.
9219,1c175d5b54b1,Summer projects are some of the most dreaded assignments to give to a student.
9220,1c175d5b54b1,"However, they are very necessary in order for students to retain information needed for the following school year."
9221,bc81b6dd85c5,"Summer projects, involving schools, should be teacher-designed in order to optimize students's learning."
9222,16c0c4d9db98,a teacher knows what to assign best based on the class curriculum.
9223,dd5467ca730f,"If students were to all decide what the project was and how it should be done, then there would be a multitude of topics and confusion amongst the class."
9224,dd5467ca730f,In seventh grade we were given a choice assignment to do.
9225,dd5467ca730f,"Although it was a fun project and allowed us to use creativity, it didn't lead us to the same information."
9226,dd5467ca730f,"In a summer project, the main purpose being to continue learning, a student-designed project may not be the best way to learn about a common topic."
9227,1d9c946fe5f6,the school year would flow much smoother with a teacher-designed project.
9228,b14030e5e3a3,In my sophomore year I was assigned a summer assignment for world history.
9229,b14030e5e3a3,"It was the same assignment given to the whole class, and was meant to be completed the same way as well."
9230,b14030e5e3a3,Completing it made it easier for my teacher and classmates to refer to as the year went on.
9231,b14030e5e3a3,"Similar to a textbook, we all were able to use the same resource to make learning easier and allow the class to flow smoother."
9232,8119ff34ecec,"On the contrary however, students may not have the time to complete a summer project in a specified way."
9233,8119ff34ecec,During summer break it is very common for people to travel or have family in town
9234,939c98a1bb77,every year I go out of town on road trips to visit family.
9235,939c98a1bb77,This year my mom told me that we would be visiting family in Africa.
9236,939c98a1bb77,Places like Africa may not have all the necessary resources to complete an assignment the exact way a teacher asks.
9237,939c98a1bb77,"Even if a student were to have resources available, constant travel may limit a student's time and ability to focus."
9238,939c98a1bb77,Students may have to get creative and modify or design their project in a way that would allow them to complete it before the beginning of the school yea
9239,0ecdc762eda7,"If a student were to design his or her project, they would likely take the easy route in order to enjoy the rest of their summer"
9240,d671b3b4b94d,"Although I have many positive qualities, I am known to take the easy route when it comes to a lot of things."
9241,d671b3b4b94d,In my fifth grade science fair we were allowed to decide our own experiments to do.
9242,d671b3b4b94d,"Instead of trying to think of a topic that may attract viewers at my booth, or something that interested me, I chose the most basic experiment I could think of, ""which paper airplane would fly the farthest."""
9243,d671b3b4b94d,When it comes to school students are prone to rush through any work given.
9244,d671b3b4b94d,"Like myself, they'd take the easy route and limit their own capabilities."
9245,c24a03a6347e,Summer projects are important for schools and teachers to implement whether it be student-designed or teacher-designed.
9246,c24a03a6347e,"However in the case of productivity, teacher-designed projects bear more benefits."
9247,c24a03a6347e,"School year flow, class content, and a student's work habits all play roles in why teacher-designed projects should be the main source of assignments given over the summer."
9248,2d6732d88e63,"Imagine this: it's the last day of school, and after ten months of constant, grueling work, you have finally completed the school year."
9249,2d6732d88e63,"However, you learn a project has been assigned over summer break; a project which requires a lot of your time, and a lot of your effort."
9250,2d6732d88e63,"Not only that, but it is on a boring, irrelevant topic, which you have absolutel zero interest in; is this fair?"
9251,2d6732d88e63,"Students get put through extreme amounts of stress over the span of the school year, and summer vacation is their break from the large amount of work and effort that they put in over the course of their 300 day journey."
9252,7a447453f7ac,"Although it is essential for students to continue to actively use their brain during their break, it is essential that the project should be student designed,"
9253,7ee1d6760124,which is proven by the students procrastination on topics they don't find interesting
9254,df87077347aa,"their increased inclination to work on something that they find interesting,"
9255,377ee62e8ebe,the fact that it is their break from school.
9256,21230d19f9d8,"School has been around for centuries, and although it is completely different now than how it once was, some things have remained the same; for example, the procrastination of students."
9257,21230d19f9d8,"Majority of students, nowadays especially with the amount of distractions they have, find themselves doing nothing all day and beginning their homework at 11:00 PM."
9258,21230d19f9d8,"When it comes to summer, the same applies; especially if given a topic they do not find interesting or relevant to them."
9259,21230d19f9d8,"If given a topic that bores them, then they will likely wait until the last month to even begin the project."
9260,21230d19f9d8,"This renders the project completely useless, as it's primary purpose was to ensure that the student remains mentally active throughout their summer break"
9261,9643a5f63566,"Summer break is the average students most favorite time of the year; it is their time to relax, spend time with family and friends, and a lot of times to do absolutely nothing at all."
9262,9643a5f63566,"In a students perfect world, no work would be assigned over break; this is obviously unrealistic, as work must be assigned to ensure that they don't come back unprepared or having forgotten things learned in prior years"
9263,de392fcab175,"However, it must be taken into account that it is their summer break: something that is looked forward too year round and a break from the long, tiresome school year that they just completed"
9264,6089d42001c5,"Some may claim that the project must be chosen by teachers, as it is their occupation and that they know what is best for the students to succeed."
9265,79777fe94eea,"Although this is correct, regardless of whether or not the summer assignment is chosen by teachers or students, it's primary purpose will still be fulfilled: to keep the student's brain active throughout the break."
9266,79777fe94eea,"In fact, if chosen by students, the chances of the goal to be fulfilled greatly increase, contrary to how it would be if it were to be chosen by teachers."
9267,65e3d883b8f0,The life of a student is extremely difficult; they are forced to do things that most adults cannot even do.
9268,65e3d883b8f0,"They are told to somehow find time for everything: school work, sports, hobbies, family, friends, and most importantly to be a kid."
9269,65e3d883b8f0,"During the school year, the fact that the student is still a kid is most times forgotten."
9270,65e3d883b8f0,"Summer vacation is their chance to finally be a kid, or at least feel like one."
9271,65e3d883b8f0,"By allowing the student to take part in a student designed project,they are able to take part in activities that they actually want to do, or research things that they are actually interested in."
9272,65e3d883b8f0,"It is always hard to find compromise, but if given an option to satisfy students as well as teachers, why not choose it?"
9273,6c33907baf55,In the passage that we are presented with the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit by telling us of the similaraties between it and the earth
9274,1e2fc24106b4,Venus is of a similar size and distance wise is not very far from us at all.
9275,8f4c24fe578b,No spacecraft has ever had any human pilots on it due to the fact that the spacefrafts never last very long once they land of the planet.
9276,8f4c24fe578b,The planet's stmosphere is made up of 97% of carbon dioxide and corrosive sulfuric acid.
9277,8f4c24fe578b,The temperature of the planet of on average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and the atomspheric pressure is almost 90 times greater than our own.
9278,8cec2b1d32a5,Long ago Venus was proably covered by oceans and may have supported various formes of life similar to those of earth.
9279,8cec2b1d32a5,"It has similar geological features such as valleys, mountains, and craters."
9280,8cec2b1d32a5,Due to its close proximity it may be the nearest option for a planetary visit.
9281,8cec2b1d32a5,NASA in particular would like to send humans to study the planet.
9282,8cec2b1d32a5,They thing that if they have the space craft hover about 30 miles above the planets surface they may be able to avoid the brunt of the problems.
9283,869320d8ffe5,"The temperature would still be about 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on earth."
9284,0039eee17c2a,"""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" in the story the author descrbes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions."
9285,0039eee17c2a,Is this technology to read emotinal expressions of humans wrong?
9286,0039eee17c2a,How do they make this technology to read people's emotions?
9287,0039eee17c2a,Who's idea was this?
9288,25590f6b03c0,"First, I think reading people's mind's by this technology is wrong"
9289,11be5bf0e449,First reason is it's none of our bussines.
9290,11be5bf0e449,Also reading people's minds is something that is totally creepy.
9291,e8d0d3050703,"This technology can detect anyone who's happy, sad, angry, and disgusted."
9292,e8d0d3050703,Everyone has their own personal secrets that he or she doesn't want to reveal their feelings.
9293,e8d0d3050703,They need to invent something to help people around the world.
9294,c681ece013ff,"Second, this idea came from Professor Thomas Huang, of the Beckman Instatute for Advanced Science at the University of Illionois, working in collaboration with Professor Nicu Sebe of the University of Amsterdam."
9295,c681ece013ff,Dr. Huang and his colleague are exports at developing better ways for humans and computers to communicate
9296,6e19f90f7ff6,Both of these professors want's to know of their invention to the world to earn credit.
9297,6e19f90f7ff6,Do they even know what their doing?
9298,ae531b4204fe,Both professors test's the painting of Mona Lisa of her emotions.
9299,ae531b4204fe,"Mona Lisa results is 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent angry."
9300,f40c68108aae,"Then, this software technology has a constructs a 3-D computer model of the face."
9301,f40c68108aae,All 44 majors muscles in the model must move like human muscles.
9302,f40c68108aae,"Movement of one or more muscles is called an ""action unit""."
9303,f40c68108aae,"Then Dr. Hunag relies on the work of psychologists, such as Dr. Paul Eckman, creator of FACS ( Facial Action Coding System."
9304,f40c68108aae,"Using video imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements in a real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa."
9305,f40c68108aae,"By weighting the different units, the software can even identify mixed emotions ( as in da Vinci's masterpiece)."
9306,f40c68108aae,Each expression is compared against a neutral face (showing no emotion).
9307,f40c68108aae,The new computer software stores similar anatomical information as electric code.
9308,f40c68108aae,This technology can read people's emotions by raising your lips at the corners of your mouth.
9309,f40c68108aae,"Then squirt your eyes slightly, to produce wrinkiling."
9310,f40c68108aae,"Holding that, raise the outer parts of your cheeks up, toward your eyes."
9311,516e41ce4a90,"Finally, in conclusion it's bad to read other personal thought's."
9312,516e41ce4a90,Both professors makes a computer to see emotions in people's mind's.
9313,516e41ce4a90,Finding the new technology is rare in the United States.
9314,516e41ce4a90,The new computer is not an ordinary science teacher grading your work this is a professional professors inventions.
9315,516e41ce4a90,In my opinion these professors should make a new invention to change the world and by not reading people's minds.
9316,1078c641ef02,Modern humans today are always on their phone.
9317,1078c641ef02,They are always on their phone more than 5 hours a day no stop .All they do is text back and forward and just have group Chats on social media.
9318,1078c641ef02,They even do it while driving.
9319,3695c85c6495,They are some really bad consequences when stuff happens when it comes to a phone.
9320,78933d337df9,Some certain areas in the United States ban phones from class rooms just because of it.
9321,e4beea06c3d0,"When people have phones, they know about certain apps that they have .Apps like Facebook Twitter Instagram and Snapchat."
9322,e4beea06c3d0,So like if a friend moves away and you want to be in contact you can still be in contact by posting videos or text messages.
9323,e4beea06c3d0,People always have different ways how to communicate with a phone.
9324,e4beea06c3d0,Phones have changed due to our generation.
9325,60c0cddc7339,Driving is one of the way how to get around.
9326,60c0cddc7339,People always be on their phones while doing it.
9327,60c0cddc7339,Which can cause serious Problems.
9328,9b1b54830dae,That's why there's a thing that's called no texting while driving.
9329,9b1b54830dae,That's a really important thing to remember.
9330,9b1b54830dae,Some people still do it because they think It's stupid.
9331,9b1b54830dae,No matter what they do they still have to obey it because that's the only way how did he save.
9332,f795933c7667,Sometimes on the news there is either an accident or a suicide.
9333,f795933c7667,It might involve someone not looking where they're going or tweet that someone sent.
9334,f795933c7667,It either injury or death.
9335,f795933c7667,"If a mysterious number says I'm going to kill you and they know where you live but you don't know the person's contact ,It makes you puzzled and make you start to freak out."
9336,f795933c7667,Which can end up really badly.
9337,175cb2f5c052,Phones are fine to use and it's also the best way to come over help.
9338,eb6702a20ab1,"If you go through a problem and you can't find help you ,always have a phone there with you."
9339,eb6702a20ab1,Even though phones are used almost every day as long as you're safe it would come into use if you get into trouble.
9340,eb6702a20ab1,Make sure you do not be like this phone while you're in the middle of driving.
9341,1465b49909d9,The news always updated when people do something stupid around that involves their phones.
9342,1465b49909d9,The safest way is the best way to stay safe.
9343,e28bfb387128,In the US many people use different methods to get around.
9344,e28bfb387128,"They walk, take a bus, but many use some sort of automobile."
9345,e28bfb387128,All these ways are very efficent but have you ever thought of maybe the outcomes of what cars do to the planet we live on?
9346,d875cc361530,Let me tell you the things that would change of limiting car usage.
9347,f0ea7702072e,"having to always worry about paying car payments or getting gas can be very pesky knowing you already have to pay for housing,food,clothing and if you have kids supporting them."
9348,f0ea7702072e,"All that can be very stressfull and make life even harder to live with, like in source 1 mother of two, Heidrun Walter talks about how ""when I had a car I was always tense."
9349,f0ea7702072e,"I'm much happier this way."""
9350,6ed7b20a77be,Her not having a car made her life way less stressfull and tense then before hand.
9351,f7d8e4db6969,Another outcome of limiting car usage would be less pollution.
9352,deb03b08737e,All these fumes are not good for the planet we live on and deffintley not good for us human beings.
9353,deb03b08737e,In source 2 it says how Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air from all the gases in the air from moter vehicles.
9354,deb03b08737e,You know how much fumes would have to be in the air for them to make a driving ban?
9355,deb03b08737e,I mean if thats not putting up a red flag i don't know what would.
9356,deb03b08737e,We only have one place to live right now and its our jobs to keep it clean and protect it.
9357,1ec350e7b96c,Without cars people are gonna have to find a way to get around.
9358,1ec350e7b96c,In source 3 it talks about the millions of Columbians finding that way when they didn't have there car to do that for them.
9359,1ec350e7b96c,"They looked too hiking, skating, and walking"
9360,5dbee1cdbde5,All these alternatives are a great way to live a healtheir life then to just let machines do the work.
9361,94218110cb53,another adavantage would be less deaths due to car accidents.
9362,a43c8f4d6b66,"So many people die every year from recklace drivers or people driving under the infulence, limiting car usage would drop these numbers down drasically and make life for us way safer."
9363,a394d15f189e,"All these little advantages would make such a big outcome to everyday life as we know it, it would make our lives better in every outlook."
9364,8970f1784367,I think you should participate in the seagoing cowboys program
9365,39c357d784d1,you get to see trueley beautifull places
9366,163f0fe1d8c1,you get to be on the ocean
9367,9db49b25bc6a,you get to love and care for the cute and adorible horses on board
9368,8b133ae556ab,you dont have to worry about them running out of food because we always carry enuff to venture the far and cool places we go to.
9369,98eda6010763,"china and i got to see the Panama Canal,all and all it's just a realy good experience and you would like it if you are an outgoing person."
9370,47aef0d4e98e,you get to be out in the ocean
9371,6a37a8234c7e,who doesn't love that and it just gives you time to explore and have fun with everything the animals the ocean the adventure and the quitness of just hereing the waves and having a great time.
9372,2b03a1a2f6f1,And that is why i think you should come aboard with us because all and all you would just have a great time.
9373,344992e09743,I think I am against the Facial Action Coding System.
9374,344992e09743,I do not think it is a good idea to use this on humans without their consent.
9375,344992e09743,Technology is important but I still do not think this is a good idea.
9376,3eedb9cd6a67,Using this on humans isn't a good thing.
9377,3eedb9cd6a67,If they want to keep an emotion hidden then I don't think it is a good idea to uncover it.
9378,7d6c5857c7e2,How can the world be a positive place if the happy people who made you happy weren't actually happy.
9379,7d6c5857c7e2,What if that person had a death of a family member and wanted to keep it a secret but some random person starts snooping around and tells everyone that that person isn't actually happy.
9380,7d6c5857c7e2,Since the article can tell a fake smile from a real smile it could possibly happen.
9381,7d6c5857c7e2,Now if the person gives you consent then it is fine but nobody should be able to read someones emotion.
9382,2e8622f64cdf,Now the thing about the facial recognition being in a classroom might make it more interesting.
9383,2e8622f64cdf,It there was a way to make school more interesting than that would be great.
9384,2e8622f64cdf,I'm not sure how far it would go to make the students happy.
9385,2e8622f64cdf,It says that it could modify the lesson like an efective human instructor
9386,2e32df94f282,but how far would it modify it.
9387,2e32df94f282,Also if this became a thing would it take the place of teachers.
9388,2e32df94f282,If so than that would be a bad thing.
9389,2e32df94f282,So many people would lose their jobs.
9390,2c9c8acc5fcb,It says that it would be able to tell if I am confused which is a good thing.
9391,2c9c8acc5fcb,That way I wouldn't have to ask the teacher to come help me.
9392,2c9c8acc5fcb,"They would just know and come help me,"
9393,b64a8695ce6a,but I still think it is a bad idea.
9394,1a83810a3c3a,I'm just not sure that it is a good idea to have something that reads emotion.
9395,1a83810a3c3a,I feel like some things that are better off covered up will be uncovered.
9396,1a83810a3c3a,Technology will consume our world if we are not careful.
9397,59a2e687566d,Do you like to travel around the world?
9398,59a2e687566d,Well if you do you should join the Seagoing Cowboys program.
9399,179e662ab20b,Even if you dont like to travel your demeanor will change when you join this program.
9400,4f55d8f49990,"We have table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whitting,and games to pass the time by."
9401,4f55d8f49990,You will be so exuberant that you joined.
9402,4f55d8f49990,You will be like a kid on Christmas morning.
9403,906eb45574bc,You will get to see new places
9404,59054e223074,",and you get to say you have been there before when other people have not been there"
9405,5ec6d610e189,You will never be melancholy on this trip beacause there is things to do all the time.
9406,db946c55b02d,You get free breakfeast every morning.
9407,db946c55b02d,"There will be eggs,panacakes,bacon,sausage and more."
9408,db946c55b02d,If you join this month you will get a free trip to the next place we go.
9409,db946c55b02d,"On the boat there is a pool,and there is a hot tub."
9410,db946c55b02d,The pool and hot tub closes at 10:00.
9411,aa20b841fa03,I cracked my ribs but that did not stop me from having fun.
9412,76e2bce1e666,"I only had to stop working for a couple days,and then I was better than ever."
9413,76e2bce1e666,When joining in this month you get you dont have to pay for a class abought the safeteys of being on a boat.
9414,76e2bce1e666,You will be more exuberant than Christmas morning.
9415,76e2bce1e666,"My freind Don Reist got me into this program,so I hope I can get you to join this program like he did to me."
9416,505629255eef,"We have table-tennis tournaments,fencing,boxing,reading,whitting,and games."
9417,505629255eef,These help take up time while going to are destination.
9418,505629255eef,"You get to see new places,and get to tell people abought it so mabey they will join to."
9419,505629255eef,"If you join in this month you dont have to pay for a class abought safety of being on a boat,and you dont have to pay for the next place we go."
9420,505629255eef,You get free breakfeast every morning.
9421,505629255eef,"When I joined I did not know abought if I would like the program but I did,and im still it and I like it even more every day."
9422,505629255eef,I hope your demeanor will change like mine did when I joined the Seagoing Cowboys program.
9423,505629255eef,That is why I think you should join this amazing program.
9424,cbadc6f67d7e,Did you know that Earth had a twin?
9425,cbadc6f67d7e,"Well not exactly a twin, but a planet that is very close to Earth in terms of it's density and size."
9426,cbadc6f67d7e,"That planet happens to be

Venus."
9427,3d2ab3841308,"Since the planet is very identical to earth, we are all going to want to explore it."
9428,3d2ab3841308,"Exploring and studying Venus comes at a cost though, it is a worthy pursuit despite the presentation of it's dangers."
9429,7997e4992269,Venus is a planet in our solar system.
9430,7997e4992269,"It is referred as the ""Evening Star,"" as its one of the brightest points of light in the night sky."
9431,7997e4992269,It is the second planet from our sun.
9432,7997e4992269,"Many people confuse Venus with being a star, because of its nickname."
9433,5c45dfbc6245,"trying to examine Venus more closely then of the safe vantage point of Earth, can be very challenging despite it being simple to see from the distance."
9434,bf9f9501bcf9,We are all closer to Mars than Venus sometimes due to the speed changes at which they orbit the Sun by.
9435,bf9f9501bcf9,Us humans send a variety of spacecrafts to the cloud-draped world for it to land on.
9436,bf9f9501bcf9,No spacecraft has survived the landing for a couple hours.
9437,bf9f9501bcf9,This means that all the previous missions to mars were all unmanned.
9438,712e533f8c88,All of these failed missions have explained why Venus hasnt been touched in more than three decades by a single spaceship.
9439,d9c69227a941,As you can tell Venus is a challenging planet for humans to study because of its reputation.
9440,aafb19de8828,The atmosphere of Venus is very thick as 97 percent Carbon Dioxide covers all of it.
9441,aafb19de8828,The planet's tempatures on the surface average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit.
9442,aafb19de8828,"The atmospheric pressure is greater than what we experience on Earth by 90, all of these conditions are way more extreme than what we experience on Earth."
9443,aafb19de8828,Trying to visit Venus would completly liquefy and melt any spacecraft near it.
9444,4e7e39563baa,Many scientist are trying to explore this planet despite its inhospital conditions because it is very identical to Earth.
9445,1624c4384df6,"It used to be one of the most Earth-like planet in our solar system, Which facsinated many Astronomers."
9446,1624c4384df6,"Venus was probably covered by many bodies of water and forms of life could have been supported, just like Earth."
9447,1624c4384df6,"The planet now has a rocky surface with many valley's, mountains, and craters that makes astronomers itch to further expore it."
9448,1624c4384df6,Despite it's very hard conditions to even get near the planet.
9449,b4f1159614d5,Venus is a very cool planet.
9450,b4f1159614d5,"As it is very Dangerous to further study and explore,It is all worth it in the long run."
9451,b4f1159614d5,The planet has very many earth-like qualities.
9452,b4f1159614d5,So it would be smart to see if there was any signs of life.
9453,b4f1159614d5,Venus is worth all the dangers because its a worthy pursuit.
9454,8b586bb6e48e,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during break.
9455,8b586bb6e48e,Should these projects be student or teacher choice?
9456,8b586bb6e48e,Are the students able to create their own?
9457,8b586bb6e48e,"Students summer break is their time ,so why not let them keep it that way?"
9458,5d9872cb3dd2,"These summer projects should be student-designed,"
9459,662334d99040,an increase in the practicality
9460,b52684546094,creativity of the project completion.
9461,2fb5fc81c438,"Summer break, the time for pool parties and vacation for students: to get away from school."
9462,2fb5fc81c438,"Therefore, why should they be forced to do some teacher choice project that they will most likely dread"
9463,ba14b4c4ac62,"To increase practicality, the student's design is more likely to get done, and get done well because it'll be their ideas ,not the same boring thing from their teachers."
9464,19a5f68f70e8,"When students and school faculty sit in a classroom on the first day of school, ready to present their summer projects that were teacher-designed they hear the same things reiterated in a hundred different ways."
9465,42444a84cb32,"Whereas student designed assignments will have a variety of different posters, illustrations ,and more."
9466,26b3a2d9417f,"Some people may say, that having the students design their own projects isn't a good idea because of the stable structure most teachers are able to implement more so then some students."
9467,b7117350db82,"While this is a good point, it can be easily counteracted with the simple statement of, if these student aren't able to create and be slightly independent now, When will they get another chance?"
9468,b7117350db82,This why the teacher-design isn't a better idea.
9469,fc6af595980f,while these projects may be dreaded either way it is far more realistic to allow the students to choose their own.
9470,fc6af595980f,"Furthermore,the creativity and the practicality of the project completion if it is student-designed is leaps and bounds more then that of the teacher designated summer assignment."
9471,fc6af595980f,"This is why summer time is the students time to play,create ,and designate."
9472,25b744a661c0,Use of the Facial Action Coding Sysytem can be very valuable for computer learning in the class room.
9473,25b744a661c0,This system can detect emotional expressions of the user which would then cause change in the computer teaching.
9474,9db3666dc026,"A child could get bored or distracted easily, but if that can be detected ahead of time, the process would be shifted to hold the focus of the student"
9475,966955bc366f,What if the student does not understand what is being taught to them throught the computer teaching?
9476,966955bc366f,"Well, the computer can read their expression and accomodate to the needs of the learner."
9477,966955bc366f,"Likewise, the student could be ahead of what is being taught, academically, which could be read by the facial decoder and adjusted in their lessons"
9478,90fdac8e2e78,Teachers could then track that data to further helps their students.
9479,2ceff909e315,Being able to automatically adjust to the needs of their user in a classroom would benefit the students and teachers of a school.
9480,ffb5154bb7c3,"First of all, computers with this facial coding would be able to help the student using it by detecting any readings of boredom."
9481,60c885c1890c,"If a student becomes bored or distracted while using computer programs, it can turn the student off from the lesson."
9482,60c885c1890c,"This technology ""can make computer-animated faces more expressive"" in any interactive activities the student might encounter to hold its attention (D'Alto)."
9483,60c885c1890c,"Also, layouts, fonts, prints, etc."
9484,60c885c1890c,"could be altered to make the lesson more interesting to the user, therefore catching the student's attention with something it deems fun."
9485,d6eb3900ecc6,"While some children become uninterested or lack focus, some students just do not have the correct cirriculum for their academic needs"
9486,358003aae738,"By using facial coding, the computer could adjust the lesson like a human tutor would."
9487,358003aae738,"for those students struggling to understand the certain area, the computer would ""modify the lesson like an effective human instructor"" (D'Alto)."
9488,358003aae738,"Likewise, some students are above the level they are given, academically, and need more of a challenge."
9489,358003aae738,"Through reading their emotions, the computer could arrange harder concepts for the student."
9490,f1619e591968,"In addition, teachers would also benefit from the use of facial coding."
9491,f472b5b30648,It is hard for teachers to truly know how a student is fairing in all areas of school.
9492,f472b5b30648,"So, by tracking their students' data, the teacher can make additional adjustments to either get the student help, or create a better challenge that will grow their education."
9493,f472b5b30648,"In using facial coding programs to calculate how their students are doing, the teacher can appeal to whatever needs their students may have, and even find out if a student is having an ""off day"
9494,1527dffaa4bd,"Based on the evidence given in the article, the use of Facial Action Coding Stystems in the classroom would be wildly valuable."
9495,1527dffaa4bd,The computer can detect many levels of emotion to accomodate their program to the students' needs.
9496,1527dffaa4bd,"If a particular lesson bores a student or that student has lack of focus, the computer can adjust and change many aspects of thier layout to catch the student's attention."
9497,1527dffaa4bd,"Also, students can receive the correct level of work- whether that be too easy or too hard."
9498,1527dffaa4bd,"And not only can students benefit, but teachers, as well."
9499,1527dffaa4bd,They can track student progress to further accomodate their needs.
9500,1527dffaa4bd,"While technology can be used for many unethical things, the Facial Action Coding System would be extremely effective in a school setting."
9501,c9869bbef60c,"A 3-D computer is a model of the face all 44 muscles and its called an ""action unit""."
9502,c9869bbef60c,"The Dr. Huang relies to work on of psycholoists and Dr. Paul Eckam, the creater of FACS (Facial Action Coding System)."
9503,c9869bbef60c,"Dr. Eckman classified six basic emotions suprise, anger, happiness, fear, and sadness."
9504,c9869bbef60c,Then he made associated each with charatcteristic movements of the facical muscles.
9505,c9869bbef60c,"Dr. Huang smiling broadly "" even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression""."
9506,c9869bbef60c,"Huang using video imagery, new emotion-recognition software tracks these movements in a real face or the painted picture of Mona Lisa."
9507,c9869bbef60c,The weighting the diffeent units in the software can be even identify mixed emotions.
9508,c9869bbef60c,Even each expression can be compared against the neutral face.
9509,c9869bbef60c,"The humans perform the same impressive ""calualtion"" every single day."
9510,c9869bbef60c,if we can probably tell our friend how they're feeling because by the way look on there faces.
9511,c9869bbef60c,But most of us would have trouble describing each facial.
9512,6d9f63b406ad,Summer projects should be student designed because honestly what student wants to do their work over the summer.
9513,51c3769ecff8,Student designed projects may include what they did over their break or what they wish they did over break
9514,5d5fd32a8715,some students will most likely forget about it anyway because its summer
9515,6cca4f3f1e6d,some people have to work also
9516,ed95f9ef13ad,"i believe it would be more interesting for a student designed projects because it would most likely be, again, what they did over the summer."
9517,2e0c5586e89b,"students, indeed yes need their education and they need to learn, that is why if a teacher just hands them a project and say here you have to have this complete before you come back after summer break."
9518,2e0c5586e89b,that will knock the interest level down a lot for students
9519,fd8a5bef9a8b,"when its summer break i love to go off and have fun with my friends and family, we always are out doing something weather it be hanging around the house or off on a trip somewhere, other students dont do this and it is honestly really cool, last summer my girlfriend and i went down to nags head with her family, i had the most fun time while we were down there, even though i accidentally left my wallet at her house."
9520,4155b1a00f1d,Students learn best when they are on their own and/or out doing something
9521,57507086a96e,the teachers already know what to do about a teacher designed project and that i do believe is why some students dont get along with the teacher.
9522,57507086a96e,"Teachers want to help kids and kids that have troubles listening or learning, i'm not saying that teachers dont listen because you have some of them that do, but, unfortunately teachers dont interact with students as they should"
9523,ae6cf9b51344,a student designed project would make it a lot more entertaining and interesting for the teacher
9524,e6d7ef92e829,"it allows the teacher to sit back and read about who that kid is, what that kid likes, and how that kid acts, it shows a lot of that and it is really helpful for the teacher to actually understand the student that is doing the project and know how his or her lifestyle is, i agree, students should come up with a student designed project over the summer."
9525,a5ddecc73d5e,"Over the summer, schools require students to do a few projects to make sure they continue learning."
9526,a5ddecc73d5e,"Over a three month long break, it is easy to forget material and or not feel motivated to learn new material."
9527,a5ddecc73d5e,Assigning projects will help encourage and enforce students to continue learning.
9528,a5ddecc73d5e,"The debate is, should teachers assign the projects or should students design their own projects."
9529,a5ddecc73d5e,"Teachers may have more knowledge and experience creating projects but if students are allowed to create their own projects, they will benefit from that experience because they got to chose what was most important for themselves to work on."
9530,a5ddecc73d5e,"They will also likely make it more broad, which allows students to make each project more individualized, each project will have a special twist to it."
9531,a5ddecc73d5e,"It will also be more discussed, it will become a trend to talk about it, students will likely feel more pressured to do it if everyone talks about it."
9532,a5ddecc73d5e,Students will also come up with enriched new project ideas.
9533,1fc19b93abee,students should design their own projects
9534,087f8166fd30,"they will appreciate it more,"
9535,8f027a108584,the project will be more discussed
9536,b8ba3f776103,the projects will help students figure out what they need to improve also allowing them to improve themselves.
9537,ac1323941a5d,"If someone for example, spends time and effort making their own meal, they are more likely to appreciate it rather then if someone gave them a meal."
9538,ac1323941a5d,"Comparatively with the students devising their own project,"
9539,cd3a11e69a3e,if they know how much time and hard work came with making it they will likely appreciate it more.
9540,0ffde1f95be5,"If they appreciate it more, they are also more likely to try harder on the project then they would have otherwise."
9541,0ffde1f95be5,They will also think it's a better idea if they formulated it rather than the teacher.
9542,0ffde1f95be5,People tend to love and appreciate their ideas more than other people's ideas.
9543,0ffde1f95be5,"Even now, their are a lot of students who complain that they don't like the projects given to them."
9544,0ffde1f95be5,"A lot of students blame the teacher if they got a bad grade on a test or a project but with this idea, they do not have someone to blame so they will be more pressured to do the project."
9545,0ffde1f95be5,"Even though teachers have more knowledge and experience, students know what they themselves need to work on and improve with."
9546,0ffde1f95be5,Giving them control and a free opportunity to dive in deeper in areas they need more improvement in would make students be thankful towards the school.
9547,0ffde1f95be5,Some students may not take advantage of this but schools still need to keep faith that the majority would.
9548,0ffde1f95be5,"The students who don't, probably also would not do it if it was teacher assigned it, but hearing ""student made"" is encouraging."
9549,0ffde1f95be5,"Therefor, more students would get it done rather then if it was teacher made."
9550,4cc0f87ff130,"Having the projects be student made will ensure it will be more discussed, which will have beautiful outcomes."
9551,363b5631cfcd,Students will be challenged to think of ideas that will benefit them as well as new ideas teachers did not think of.
9552,363b5631cfcd,"There's more students then teachers, someone is bound to think of a new unique idea."
9553,363b5631cfcd,Students will have a chance to make their summer projects fun and something to look forward to.
9554,363b5631cfcd,Another reason is teachers assign projects but sometimes they get busy and can't think of new ideas or don't have time to discuss with other teachers to find the best idea.
9555,363b5631cfcd,"Students on the other hand, probably have thousands of ideas they've wanted to do but were never given the chance."
9556,363b5631cfcd,They also have a younger mind that may have different ideas then a older mind would have.
9557,363b5631cfcd,"Students are also with each other more than teachers are, they will discuss more, if they're allowed to make it fun, it may become a trend to talk about."
9558,363b5631cfcd,"These projects may also bring students together, if they are working together to make a project they all agree on, that;s teamwork."
9559,363b5631cfcd,They may also check in on each other for inspiration and or just because this experience successfully made them closer.
9560,363b5631cfcd,This also may create some useful peer pressure to do their work and learn.
9561,363b5631cfcd,Maybe this will lead to students doing work more often overall and bonding with their peers with learning.
9562,363b5631cfcd,Learning will become more than a individual process and more than just reading from a text book.
9563,1ca78ca35550,"It is important to take a minute and consider what you want to learn, how you'll learn it, as well as what areas you need more education in."
9564,a9bb6d6cb762,This experience will give students more control and prepare them for college.
9565,a9bb6d6cb762,"It is important for kids, especially teenagers to understand how to use control and work independently."
9566,a9bb6d6cb762,"If they get to design a project, they will start thinking about their education and what they like verses don't like."
9567,a9bb6d6cb762,"This will teach them how to figure that out on their own with a little bit of support, preparing them for the real world."
9568,a9bb6d6cb762,"When they start discussing, it will continue to help them think how to make the project and themselves more individual."
9569,90ffb97cbfd4,Yes this may just be a small few projects they do over the summer
9570,05385e3f1707,but it can be seen as so much more than that.
9571,05385e3f1707,"It will improve everyone's ability to work with others, which is a crucial skill in life."
9572,05385e3f1707,It will be challenging to combine and compromise on different ideas.
9573,05385e3f1707,"If used correctly, you can figure out more about yourself, for example, if you like to work individually verses in a group, what kind of learning style you want the project to be, what the project is on, how much work you're willing to put into it, and so many other things."
9574,285113e507c4,"students should be making the projects for summer break instead of teachers because they will appreciate it more, the project will be more discussed, and the projects will help students figure out what they need to improve also allowing them to improve themselves."
9575,285113e507c4,This will provide a amazing opportunity and experience for students which will cause them to love the school even more.
9576,285113e507c4,New ideas will stem from this as well as a new found love for learning and education.
9577,8fef7954ddc5,"I am going to show my opinion about Texting or being on the phone while driving and, I show some you'll what could happened when you decide to be on the phone while driving."
9578,8fef7954ddc5,"An I hope when you are reading this, I hope you chance your mind about texting while driving and I should thank all my reader for taking the time up to reading this essay."
9579,7593e5ca195c,"When you are driving a car you hear a text pop up on your phone and you want to get it so bad and you do but, when you do you stop paying attention to the road for just a minute then a car behind you hunks because you aren't driving right and that make you jump so you start driving right."
9580,7593e5ca195c,"The driver was just lucky that he just got hunk at or it could've binned much worst like a car accident, and someone could have got hurt"
9581,b8cb74f0b493,"In my opinion people shouldn't not be texting while driving because it only takes a simple mistake, and someone could get hurt."
9582,7200bef791c5,I think that it was a good idea that modern cars develop cars that you can call people and talk to people on the phone while driving plus they have their full attention
9583,83554e739502,"When you are texting while driving you looking up and down while driving and I would suggest people should put that do not disturb on your phone or you can put it in the glove department, so you won't be interrupted while driving."
9584,ebfbfa07df46,My conclusion to all this is drive safe because I don't want to look on the news and see anybody getting hurt because of you are on your phone.
9585,ebfbfa07df46,If you don't care do it to save the other people from driving and I see why they are pushing this to be outlaws so there could be less accident on the road.
9586,ebfbfa07df46,I hope and thank you for reading my essays.
9587,7dbcd9f70ff6,"What if there was a way to tell teacher's if student's are sad, mad, happy by using a computer."
9588,7dbcd9f70ff6,Something that will tell teachers if that student is confused on what is being taught.
9589,ad8dccb92640,"Teens now of days hide their emotion's from parent's ,teachers, friends, anybody that's close to them"
9590,d5ff735a2430,.
9591,d5ff735a2430,You won't know how that child feel's.
9592,d5ff735a2430,"Holding their emotions in, can cause problems in the classroom."
9593,d5ff735a2430,"Student's will lose focus on what's going on the class, thinking about thing's on their mind's."
9594,4b1bc00a3660,"The lastest software innovation from Prof. Huang can tell you if someone is mad, sad, or happy."
9595,4b1bc00a3660,All the computer need's is a 3-D computer model of that person face.
9596,c8a220cfbfb9,Having this kind of technology to read expressions can be good in a classrooms.
9597,9ee580a611de,It'll tell teacher if that student is confused or bored.
9598,9ee580a611de,"This type of technology will also tell if students are happy, mad, or sad."
9599,9ee580a611de,"Teachers can confront students by asking if their okay, what part of the lesson in confusing to them."
9600,63025df09e33,"Using this techology more kids will get good grade, even more kids will gradute."
9601,63025df09e33,Students will be able to get work done because of teacher asking if their okay or what they don't get about what's being taught.
9602,d9d9758583d1,Can you tell if someone is happy or sad?
9603,a147ab05be94,Using technology to read students facial expressions can help out in so many different ways.
9604,dce7ce64d06f,"A classroom computer can read a students facial expressions,"
9605,45390fa903ab,"they use facial imagery,"
9606,ab8a28d31f2f,humans perform the same calculations every day.
9607,e6c61a17044b,A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming bored or is happy or sad.
9608,4241992d80a0,"If you smile when an ad pops up on your screen another similar ad might appear but, if an ad pops up and you frown then it won't have the same ad come up again."
9609,4241992d80a0,Because of this the students would be happier and cheerful.
9610,4241992d80a0,If a student was sad or bored when working on a lesson then it would change the lesson and make it more fun and then it would be more effective.
9611,4241992d80a0,This would make the children learn more and not dread being at school.
9612,b7edf5d57865,Using video imagery to recognize the facial emotion.
9613,98f57a0c8bcd,This weights the different units of the face so that the software can identify mixed emotions.
9614,98f57a0c8bcd,Because of this they can tell all of the different things the painting was feeling.
9615,98f57a0c8bcd,Every expression is compared against a face that shows no emotion at all.
9616,98f57a0c8bcd,This is so that they can know what to look for in the face and see the differences between a neutral face and a face with mixed emotions.
9617,c71546fde8a6,Humans perform the same calculations every day.
9618,4514334ebdb1,Humans can tell if someone is sad or worried etc.
9619,4514334ebdb1,by their facial expressions.
9620,4514334ebdb1,Because of this we know peoples feelings sometimes.
9621,4514334ebdb1,"We would have trouble describing exactly what they were feeling just by looking at their face but, thats what the Facial Action Coding System does."
9622,4514334ebdb1,This is saying that people can't tell exactly what other people are feeling just by their faces so that what the Facial System does.
9623,67c7574e1d2e,The Facial Action Coding system does so many great things that would help schools and society.
9624,67c7574e1d2e,"It helps with schooling because it could make it more fun, they use video imagery which helps recognize the facial emotion, and humans perform this act every day but, the Facial System helps with expressing the emotion."
9625,67c7574e1d2e,These all help the world in so many ways.
9626,03148bb6d600,In the article Luke was asked by his freind don to go to Europe on a cattle boat.
9627,03148bb6d600,Luke couldn't say no so when he said yes that would change his life.
9628,03148bb6d600,So then now he has been on nine trips since the first ever trip that he has taken.
9629,03148bb6d600,Luke was always busy tending the cattle during the day.
9630,03148bb6d600,He was having lots of fun even when he got knocked over the boat and broken his ribs.
9631,03148bb6d600,He was playing board games and everything like that to keep him busy while he was healing.
9632,03148bb6d600,The reason of Luke going on trips across the oceans because he likes it and he was born to do it.
9633,03148bb6d600,Also his freind asked Luke to come with him to keep him company during the trips.
9634,03148bb6d600,Luke was waiting for some thing to drastically change his life and he to his wish off the drastic change.
9635,03148bb6d600,"Luke would stop going with don if Luke didn't like the motion sickness,or because there where a lot of storms,or he didn't like tending the cows during the long and tiring journey."
9636,03148bb6d600,If the possibility was that Luke didn't like the sea his freind would be like are you ok and or something like that.
9637,03148bb6d600,In conclusion Luke loves the sea and he wants to keep going out and adventuring the wild and the unknown.
9638,03148bb6d600,Luke couldn't say no because it was his freind don and he wanted to explore another island.
9639,03148bb6d600,Luke loves the same because he likes tending the cows and he likes his fellow crew mates that are with him on his journeys to the out and the open sea.
9640,03148bb6d600,Another reason that is because he wants to be in dangerous storms and worlpools.
9641,03148bb6d600,Luke want to take the risks in the dangerous sea.
9642,0f0ba55fd585,Studying venus is a worthy pursuit becaue it is a well known planet
9643,286840f409d1,venus is the closet planet to earth and also has the hottest surface temperatue of any planet in our solar system . ''
9644,286840f409d1,astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most earth-like planet in our solar system '' this shows that venus is a likely planet.
9645,286840f409d1,"There are numerous factors contribute to venus's reputation as a challenging planet for human to study , However NASA is working on other ways to study venus ."
9646,286840f409d1,''Many researchers are working on innovations that would allow our machines to last long enough to contribute meaningfully to out knowledge of venus ''
9647,42933bf1ffc6,this shows that its alot to learn about venus
9648,125f60a67292,.
9649,125f60a67292,"""striving to meet the meet the challenge presented by venus has vaulse , not only because of insight to be gained on the planet itself , but also because of human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors."

9656,0428f0746482,"First, people have many different emotions."
9657,64946afdcc0d,Most of humans would have trouble describing each favial trait.
9658,64946afdcc0d,Whenever someone tightens their lips that mean that they are in anger.
9659,64946afdcc0d,Computer can recognize the subtle facial movements that human use to express how they feel.
9660,64946afdcc0d,"When someone make a movement of one or more muscles that is called ""action unit."""
9661,8d389a0d770c,"Then, many characters can make a movements of facial muscles."
9662,a889b506d648,"For example, when you are surprise, you have your mouth open and raises your eyebrows."
9663,a889b506d648,Each expresseion that people makes is compared against a neutral face.
9664,a889b506d648,Muscular action units indicate the difference between a genuine smile and forced one.
9665,45e761ff9fc1,"Finally, making a communication with others will also showed your facial expressions."
9666,0260b520c556,You can tell how your friends is feeling by looking on their faces.
9667,0260b520c556,Computers can tracks your facial movements and expressions.
9668,0260b520c556,Computers stores similar anatomical information as electronic code.
9669,0260b520c556,"For example, computer can recognize when you are becoming confused or bored."
9670,09762aabdb1d,Making a facial movements and expression while communicating with others is important because it will tell the others how you feels.
9671,4dd73ed4369e,"Mona Lisa don't smile often, but the computer can make her face smile by using the imagery."
9672,4dd73ed4369e,Facial impression and movements are not just for communicating it can also be in while looking at someone or reading a books.
9673,e87dcaa1be25,"Do i think that using technology to read emotion expressions of students in a classroom is valable you may ask,"
9674,18888500b310,It is a marvoulous idea.
9675,ec6e9488d042,Technology has come so good in the past 17 years.
9676,b1e0ba9f6b1f,I remember back in 2000 when the flip phones had just come out and fast forwars 17 years later we now have a computer that can read anyones facial expression and tell us how they are feeling.
9677,b1e0ba9f6b1f,"I can't even begin to imagine how much more advanced technology is going to get later on in life, it already seems to be that we could possibly have all the technology we could ask for, yet people all around the world just seem to be getting better and thinking of smarter ways to invent new things."
9678,b3cd07ffd906,Why is this a good idea you may ask.
9679,b3cd07ffd906,"For starters if technology will be able to read kids expressions while learning and being in class for teachers there will be one very good benifit. """
9680,b3cd07ffd906,"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"" Dr. Huang predicts this is going to be a very good thing for teachers, because teachers will be able to know what a kid is feeling this means that the teach will no longer have to keep going over the same information with the same kids just because one kid does not understrand it or isnt paying attention."
9681,f456aecc3f38,"The teacher can focus on those targeted students spicificly, and not have to go over the same information multiply times."
9682,f456aecc3f38,Knoledge is a great thing to have.
9683,9a2ea192761d,"One good benifit from this is that teachers can teach more to kids in a more faster way so they can get more things done,"
9684,5132162ec81d,because the FACS will tell you if the kids understands the information and or get bored that way techers can work with those kids in a different time and move on to more things with the kids that do understand it.
9685,2543a2006917,Having computers that can read kids expresions to tell you whether you are bored or confused is a genius idea.
9686,2543a2006917,It will be a good thing for both reachers and kids.
9687,2543a2006917,The science behind it is also neat for people to understand how it came about the FACS.
9688,8744acff243c,"Soccer team, basketball team, football team, drama club, yearbook club, student council, math club, marching band and more."
9689,8744acff243c,"So many sport teams and school clubs available to any student, usually free, but still some students conclude that they don't want to do any activities after school."
9690,d800919b7116,Students should have to participate in at least one extracurricular activity because it is beneficial to every aspect of their life.
9691,589c3de41d21,Extracurricular activities can help improve students' social skills
9692,2dc61f545e33,they have to interact and work with each other outside of school so much that many students will even start to make new friends.
9693,58b9eea4844e,If a student is playing a sport it will help him/her get outside and get fresh air after hours of being stuck inside school.
9694,53fc4d61a14c,Playing a sport will require exercise making the students healthier and therefore happier.
9695,56e023780343,and are sometimes unhealthy because of the lack of exercise
9696,67ad957355cb,Extracurricular activities are powerful learning tools because students are learning while having fun.
9697,d73bb59cdcbe,"Students on sport teams might learn about teamwork and the positive effect of good sportsmanship while students in drama club might learn about how to project your voice and speak confidently on stage, two very important traits if you want to be a leader."
9698,ac6761e92f42,Joining an extracurricular activity may give you new interests and goals in your life
9699,370fb490b00d,"For example, I started my first season of marching band last fall and now it is a very important thing to me and I have made it one of my life goals to march in D.C.I."
9700,370fb490b00d,(Drum Core International): where the best and biggest marching bands in the world compete for title of grand champion.
9701,15f666b705fc,Many students use homework as an excuse not to participate in after-school activities
9702,73c62197d0f4,But that problem can be easily fixed because there are several clubs and teams that meet once a week or even meet on the weekend.
9703,a02bc7e65c3d,Another excuse is that the price to participate in these activities is too much.
9704,f2ddee6b546b,But that problem can also be fixed easily because there are several free clubs available to students.
9705,50c115038ad3,"Extracurricular activities should be made mandatory because they help students socially and health wise, are educational and can guide students to new interests and goals, and can be a very small commitment that doesn't interrupt homework."
9706,50c115038ad3,They can do all that while still being very fun and exciting.
9707,50c115038ad3,"Schools are offering teams and clubs that are fun, educational, and can be joined without any disadvantage, they deserve to be mandatory."
9708,d64a413e66c0,"Yes,the use of this techology is valuable beacuse maybe what you'er are upset and there is no one there to make you feel better."
9709,cb0d98237c00,That at least according to some new computer software that can recognize emotions.
9710,cb0d98237c00,"The person who is making the software is Thomas Huang,of the Beckman institute for advanced science at the university of illinois""(paragraph 1) .Huang is doing this by trying to recongnize other people facial expression."
9711,cb0d98237c00,This computer software is a 3-D printer which can make a mode of the face.
9712,cb0d98237c00,"""The process begin when the computer constructs a 3-D computer model of the face; all 4 major muscles in the model must move like human muscles""(paragraph3).A 3-D printer is way better then a normal printer."
9713,cb0d98237c00,At least for a 3-D printer it gives you all the close up details of how they are feeing.
9714,cb0d98237c00,"The movement of the one is called action unit according to

Dr. huang who relies on the work of psychologist,such as Dr. Pual Eckman,creator of FACS (paragraph 3).The computer will calculate this everyday ""In fact, we human perform this same impressive ""calculation"" everyday amd for instance,you can probably tell how a friend feeling simply by the look on her face""(Paragraph5).This can calulate every single movement that you make."
9715,cb0d98237c00,So here what the people who is making the software want you to do.
9716,cb0d98237c00,This a partner they will like for you to take a mirror a genunie smile and forced one.
9717,cb0d98237c00,The real smile is called a zygomatic major that lift the corner of your mouth.

9722,6db934708834,i think they should try a new ship or try to make it to somewhere else before trying to make it over there try somewhere closer so than maybe you find out how to get there or mybad get close to get to there that just how i see it if you say it worthy than try a diffent plant just to see if it easy to find out how to get to that plant you been talking about that why when u pull up all the reseach you can say as i was reach i find two way to get to the plant and they gone say how u find all of that to go with that and say when u find stuff you can get stuff from it.
9723,85b2f24f59fa,Your principal has decided all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.
9724,c5b2ecb3888e,I agree
9725,a19164023b9a,now days all kids do is stay home and be on there phones and do nothing.
9726,a19164023b9a,I know that because I used to do the same thing before and i didn't like to do anything at all but then I started playing a sport and it help a lot but i think that
9727,4bc1fb6cfb08,Participating in a extracurricular activity may help you by staying healthy
9728,19cdfc67c17b,get you out of trouble
9729,fd8916f603dc,and get you in a good college.
9730,e551308200c3,"by playing a sport you can help prevent a lot of things like maintain a good weight, and keep you from getting sick."
9731,e551308200c3,"Keeping a good weight is good for your health because it keeps you from getting other diseases,more than 1/4 of the people in the U.S. are obese."
9732,e551308200c3,Why not start at a young age and prevent from being sick and other things.
9733,e551308200c3,"Another thing that can help is eating healthy, we can prevent sickness to in order to do that you might want to think about trying out a new sport."
9734,6420f2ab3b54,you can avoid a lot of drama.
9735,6420f2ab3b54,"I learned that social media can get you into a lot of trouble, half of the time a lot of the drama comes from social media."
9736,6420f2ab3b54,Maybe if you join a club or a sports team you can think before doing something that can get you in trouble.
9737,6420f2ab3b54,One time my friend made the soccer team but she got in trouble so they kicked her off the team and she learned from her mistake and never got in trouble again.
9738,6420f2ab3b54,When in your in a cub or playing a sports half of the time you don't have time to be in drama get in trouble.
9739,5a3eec247ac4,now a days colleges are looking to see if you have participated in any sports or clubs.
9740,5a3eec247ac4,When i graduate high school i want to go to college and a study to be a general surgeon and participating in a sport or joining a club can help me get into a college.
9741,3807056afdd3,You meed new people when you join new clubs and make new friend ships.
9742,56b0b7471bb4,When you want to go into a club or in sports do something that you like not something your friends like or something that can help you in life with.
9743,79fca67c97e2,"staying healthy,getting out of trouble,and going into a new college can help you when you participate in a extracurricular activity."
9744,79fca67c97e2,staying healthy by playing a sports and eating healthy can prevent you from getting sick.
9745,79fca67c97e2,Staying out of trouble can avoid a lot of drama from school and social media think before you do something your going to regret .
9746,79fca67c97e2,Joining a club or participating in a sport can help you get into the college you want and you can meet new people and make new friend ships.

9751,5d4931b1466e,Thomas would sure like to know how is friend is feeling; but he can't because there's no humanly way possible to if Charlie doesn't want him to know right?
9752,5d4931b1466e,Well actually he can
9753,7084b4d16844,"There's a new kind of technology called Facial Action Coding System, or FACS, which enables computers to identify human emotions."
9754,7084b4d16844,The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable
9755,27f441db6728,"Like in ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'Alto, it could be used to show when a kid is becoming bored and let the teacher know so that the instructor could switch the lesson up to grab the kid's attention"
9756,8c729e424c45,Another effective was it could be used would be for it to show how some kids are feeling to limit them getting into any kinds of trouble.
9757,686002ccc919,And finally it could be used to detect if one student just isn't grasping the matter of the subject that everyone else is getting with no problem.
9758,686002ccc919,There are endless ways this technology could be used to better a classroom and this technology should be used in a classroom with students.
9759,eef157551e4f,"In the article, Nick D'Alto used a quote from Dr. Huang which was ""'A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored,' Dr. Huang predicts."
9760,eef157551e4f,"'Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor."
9761,2c3bba7a3ad7,"In the sense that kids often time get bored in class, hence the reason they have a bad grade or get in trouble in that class, something has to change."
9762,2c3bba7a3ad7,"Maybe it's the child's fault, but your traditional lesson isn't the most fun."
9763,2c3bba7a3ad7,If the instructor could find out what's boring the child and change the lesson to keep the child entertained then maybe the child wouldn't get into so much trouble with that teacher or maybe the child's grade in the class would take a huge leap.
9764,2c3bba7a3ad7,Who says learning can't be fun?
9765,2c3bba7a3ad7,With FACS learning could be something kids like to do.
9766,b3f3a5c70b13,"In addition to keeping everyone awake, FACS could be used to keep people who aren't feeling too good get better."
9767,6cc62a3c5253,Everyone deals with things that others probably don't know about.
9768,6cc62a3c5253,With FACS a student could come into class like Charlie and no one knows about his frustrations so they try to do their normal jokes and games with him.
9769,6cc62a3c5253,"If a student ever comes into class not feeling the best or not wanting to be bothered, FACS could sense that and instead of people messing with that kid or having that kid be bothered, that child could have the option of being away from everyone while the child cools down."
9770,6cc62a3c5253,That could stop the child from being involved in a physical altercation or any altercations at that.
9771,bdd1f7debaf4,"Finally, everyone knows that all children learn at their own speed."
9772,bdd1f7debaf4,FACS could be used to find out whose stuck on someting that everyone is flying through.
9773,0b82750b8eb6,"When the teacher is teaching something that everyone but one student understands and the teacher stops for questions, that one student may feel too embarrassed to ask a question so the lesson would go on and only get more difficult as time goes by."
9774,0b82750b8eb6,"Instead of that happening, FACS would let the teacher know what kid that is so that the teacher could reach out to the kid and give them extra practice or even a little tutoring if they need it, that could really be a huge help to children that don't learn as fast as others."
9775,0b82750b8eb6,Usong FACS to determine that could really translate for the great or good of the grades of students everywhere.
9776,cf97ee0756ef,"In order to make the classroom a more happy place, a better place, FACS should be used with students."
9777,cf97ee0756ef,FACS could detect bordem so that no kid is bored enough to drift into space or sleep and miss valuable work time.
9778,cf97ee0756ef,FACS would be good for keeping kids that are dealing with things away from people that'll trigger them.
9779,cf97ee0756ef,Also FACS can be used to show weather or not children have questions and need help but are embarrassed to say so.
9780,cf97ee0756ef,The use of this technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom is very valuable.
9781,91a9e61f76c2,"The technolgy is good for seeing emotions in paintings I can see that but, my question is if we actually except it or need it at some point."
9782,91a9e61f76c2,What the story says has my attention but not quite everybody's.
9783,91a9e61f76c2,The FAC i'll Say its not valuabe because students wouldn't be really into that maybe some will but the majority will not.
9784,91a9e61f76c2,The object looks like something kids need in there life to learn someting new.
9785,91a9e61f76c2,That will motivate them for them to do great things and try to invent other things.
9786,91a9e61f76c2,I just writing what I know how to right this doen't really matter because imma fail anyways but this story wouldn't really valuable why because I know our generation and if we have it in our school no one would care.
9787,91a9e61f76c2,"I wouldn't here one person say ""hey lets check out the FAC"" because I know what im saying I would like to speak the truth."
9788,91a9e61f76c2,"The story had some interstesting facts about how could detect everything from the body (Alto, page 1)."
9789,af02bc8e1af3,So I would say that it really isnt valuable.

9841,271eee0bd023,"Initially, as technology is advancing daily and students find themselves online more often, this system could improve their lessons."
9842,5a7f6c760add,Electronics as of now are programmed to teach a student however are unable to sense how the student is feeling or how they are actually doing on their assignment.
9843,5a7f6c760add,"As the author states in the article, ""most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"" something which computers are unable to detect (para."

9857,88aabcf8a273,"This system can pick up on a fake emotion, the author explains how it can read a ""fake smile"" and that to them ""faces don't lie"" (para."
9858,88aabcf8a273,8).
9859,88aabcf8a273,"If this system is able to sense when a student is unhappy or angry, this could be used as an advantage in helping the student."
9860,88aabcf8a273,"Not only this, but the author explains that ""moving your facial muscles not only expresses emotions, but may even help produce them"" (para."
9861,88aabcf8a273,9).
9862,88aabcf8a273,"Taking both of these statements into account, and allowing them to be incorporated into the classroom, students may enjoy attending school and learning new things."
9863,8bb23abfcd47,"Consequently, this system would be valuable to classrooms and would allow for improvement to be made within schools and the students."
9864,8bb23abfcd47,"Overall, it is evident that computers are unable to read emotions and reciprocate to the individual adequately."
9865,8bb23abfcd47,"This system might prove to reengage students in their learning, and improve their moods altogether."
9866,02c2c7df68c9,Not using cars or not using cars as much can be extremely benefitial
9867,ce306c02966c,not only the enviroment
9868,26550e60a301,also to the health of people
9869,119bb2effec1,Getting excersise is extremely important in modern times heart diesease is a major factor in todays society and that can be easily prevented with minutes of excersise everyday .
9870,119bb2effec1,The less you drive the more your bound to walk or ride a bike to your destination
9871,b8b00d1c2fe0,While having completely carless communities can be an inconvinice .
9872,b8b00d1c2fe0,Cutting back on car usage and even using hybrid cars can be benefitial to the enviroment
9873,292639024bd6,Even in the United States cars are becoming less relivant.
9874,292639024bd6,Not because they are not useful but because cities are becoming so compact that there is no longer a use to drive cars to stores and shops.
9875,292639024bd6,The only time people drive is for long distance or to work or school when it is cold or raining
9876,968b675601b5,"If I could ride the bus to and from school I would, but, they refuse to pick me up in the mornings so I drive my moms

SUV

istead while im not complaining because I dont have to ride in sticky seats or be constantly harassed by the kid behind me kicking my seat."
9877,968b675601b5,"Driving an

SUV

(which is also extremely hard to park)

is not a very efficient way to get to school"
9878,935f3006530e,While I tried walking it was difficult getting to school on time and i was depleeted of energy.
9879,935f3006530e,So driving became the most efficient way.
9880,95f54bc1ade8,The new technology is very helpful showing about whats more to a picture or a frame.
9881,be8d49889432,Why is this important well beacuse people want to know about more about the picture or of what the picture is showing
9882,753ee594509b,"for example, Mona Lisa smile to not be so serious in the picture imagine having a cute picture but your so serious."
9883,753ee594509b,You can change that with new tecnology.
9884,cdc1a417c27b,Comperters are very helpful theses days in many ways.
9885,c2a05d45eab0,"For example it can be useful for making payments , searching up information you need , paperwork, photoshop, diffrent apps that are useful on making your life better."
9886,c2a05d45eab0,Its a better sorce of seaching stuff up learning more about the world and the physics.
9887,c2a05d45eab0,Theres more to this i mostly use it for searching up information about the topic i want to learn about.
9888,c2a05d45eab0,Its easier for me beacuse i dont like rreading alot and i can just look up videos instead of having to sit there for an hour looking up information or reading it beacuse reading makes me sleepy.
9889,c2a05d45eab0,Thats why i think the web is an awsome resorse for people that need to be informed and thought many diffrent things.
9890,3d163b57c783,Many people use this method by making there photogrophy work look better than it is.
9891,da146607809f,Its a very good sorce for people that have the job as a photographer beacuse they will make everything work in many ways.
9892,da146607809f,For example if something in the picture gets in the way the computer will show u how to get rid or it instead of doing all the extra stuff on taking a whole lot of pictures that look the same or worst.
9893,da146607809f,Why waist your time on doing that instead get the app or the program and get to steping its way better and easier to get pictures that are perfect.
9894,3858e5a7c1e6,The future.
9895,3858e5a7c1e6,"Everyone wonders what it will look like, what it will be like but that is up to our future generations ."
9896,3858e5a7c1e6,The young people today will eventually be our future.
9897,3858e5a7c1e6,They will be the ones we look up to for solutions and ideas.
9898,3858e5a7c1e6,By having extracurricular activities be a must in schools we are only making school systems better and by making school systems better we are making our future better.
9899,3858e5a7c1e6,"There are so many fun yet different extracurricular activities for everyone such as dance, student council or debate."
9900,5abd2e60572a,Schools should make participating in an extracurricular activity mandatory for students
9901,3329a1abbf18,"it will give the students a chance to explore their passions,"
9902,408aeb8634e9,it will provide them an opportunity to make life-long friends
9903,cf1fafbab96f,it will benefit the schools participating.
9904,7e58ae589326,"By providing students the chance to participate in extracurricular activities, you are letting them get a head-start in life."
9905,7e58ae589326,"By trying out different activities, they will be able to determine which one they like the most and want to pursue as a career."
9906,7e58ae589326,"Many students in high school still don't know what career path they want to pursue, but students who had to do an extracurricular will already know which one they prefer to others."
9907,7e58ae589326,"Thus, they won't be puzzled by the time they have to choose a career."
9908,7e58ae589326,"Additionally, participating in extracurricular activities will help strengthen their resume when they need it."
9909,7e58ae589326,A student who has done multiple extracurricular activities will be preferred to another student who has not done any.
9910,7e58ae589326,"Furthermore, my sister, Generic_Name, never knew what career she wanted to pursue until she took a building class as an extracurricular in 9th grade."
9911,7e58ae589326,She instantly fell in love with it and could use that extracurricular class as a bonus on her resume.
9912,7e58ae589326,"She is now in her first year at Yale, studying engineering."
9913,7e58ae589326,This shows why extracurricular activities will help students discover their passion.
9914,31c62b803a64,"Every year, many new kids will move to the area and come to a new school so providing an additional way to get to know others is needed."
9915,31c62b803a64,The new kid will be able to connect with others that share similar interests and it will make the whole moving process much easier.
9916,31c62b803a64,"In addition, having a friend that shares the same interests as you will make your bond much stronger and make you much better friends."
9917,31c62b803a64,This program will also benefit shy kids or students who are more quiet and reserved.
9918,31c62b803a64,It will help them because in school they might be more quiet if they don't feel comfortable or if none of the subjects interest them.
9919,31c62b803a64,"However, if they are in an environment where they enjoy what they are doing and are with people like them they will be more likely to branch out."
9920,31c62b803a64,"When I was nine, my school required I do a sport."
9921,31c62b803a64,"Thus, I decided to do swim team."
9922,31c62b803a64,When I started the sport I was new to town.
9923,31c62b803a64,We had just moved from California to Virginia so I did not have many friends.
9924,31c62b803a64,"However, I made many friends quite easily because of swim team."
9925,31c62b803a64,I made friends faster than usual since we shared similar interests.
9926,31c62b803a64,We all liked swimming and we would all have friendly competitions.
9927,31c62b803a64,We even took trips together which made our bond even stronger.
9928,31c62b803a64,We helped each other through hard times.
9929,31c62b803a64,"Even though, two of my friends from swim team switched schools I am still very close friends with all of them."
9930,31c62b803a64,The bond we created will last a life time.
9931,53527df27afe,"It will keep students busy and occupied; thus, they won't get into trouble as much."
9932,53527df27afe,"I was once told that if you are bored, it can often lead to trouble because if you're busy you have no time to make trouble."
9933,53527df27afe,"Also, by having students do extracurricular activities it will seem as if the school gives off lots of well rounded students who have many skills."
9934,53527df27afe,This will seem very impressive.
9935,53527df27afe,"Lastly, the school's students will most likely have a higher grade point average (GPA) and better scores in general compared to schools who don't require extracurricular activities."
9936,53527df27afe,This is because studies show that students who do extracurricular activities such as sports or clubs have done better in academics and will learn time management and balance better than other kids.
9937,53527df27afe,This is why enforcing extracurricular activities will improve schools.
9938,a7fb29a04c33,schools should adopt a new policy of having students preform at least one extracurricular activity.
9939,a7fb29a04c33,"This is a great way to help students find their passion, make new friends and better the schools."
9940,a7fb29a04c33,Students will be to find an extracurricular that sparks interest for them and hopefully it will turn out to be their career.
9941,a7fb29a04c33,They will also be able to make strong friendships through this program.
9942,a7fb29a04c33,It will also ease the anxiety of making friends for new kids.
9943,a7fb29a04c33,"Lastly, the program will benefit schools by making their students more well rounded, increasing the overall GPA of their students and help keep students occupied and out of trouble after school."
9944,a7fb29a04c33,"In fact, all schools in America should decide to make this a requirement."
9945,a7fb29a04c33,Not only will it make our school systems better but it will also improve our students; which are our future.
9946,a7fb29a04c33,"The students in our schools today will eventually become leaders, officials, activists, doctors, lawyers, actors and politicians."
9947,a7fb29a04c33,So if this program will better schools and the lives that hold our future then there should be no question about implementing it.
9948,251913fbf9fb,"the challenge of exploring venus is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky, making it simple for even an amateur stargazer to spot."
9949,251913fbf9fb,"however, this nickname, is misleading since venus is actually a planet."
9950,251913fbf9fb,"In a solar system, venus is the second planet from our sun."
9951,251913fbf9fb,"they call venus like the earth twin..

Venus is the closest to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too."
9952,251913fbf9fb,"Earth, venus, and mars,our other planetary neighbor, orbit the sun at different speeds."
9953,251913fbf9fb,"While venus is simple to see from the distant but safe ventage pointof Earth, it has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely."
9954,251913fbf9fb,MY ESSAY.
9955,251913fbf9fb,"The callenge of exploring venus is one of the biggest points of light in the night sky, these differences is speed mean that sometimes we are closer to mars and others times to venus."
9956,251913fbf9fb,Because venus is sometimes right aroundthe corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent dioxide blankets venus.
9957,251913fbf9fb,"Also notable, venus has the hottest surface temperature af any planet in our solar system, even though mercury is closer to our sun."
9958,251913fbf9fb,astronomers are fascinated by venus because it may well once have been the most Earth like planet in our solar system.
9959,251913fbf9fb,"long ago, venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life, just like Earth."
9960,251913fbf9fb,"Today, venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."
9961,251913fbf9fb,"The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such ass valleys, mountains, and craters."
9962,251913fbf9fb,Imagine a blimp like behicle hovering 30 or so miles above the roiling venusian landscape.
9963,251913fbf9fb,"However, peering at venus from a ship orbiying or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions bacuse most forms of light cannot penetrate the dense atmosphere, rendiring standard forms of photography and videography ineffective."
9964,251913fbf9fb,A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent dioxide blankets venus.
9965,571671032f2f,"Summer projects are no fun, but they are a great way for students to be engaged in their studies over the long summer break."
9966,571671032f2f,"In my experience, whenever I had summer projects given to me by a teacher, I did better in the class because on the first day of school I already had some knowledge of the topic."
9967,bb44f0b4ed49,I think summer projects should be teacher designed
9968,bee29ad0071d,"it will make it easier on their students,"
9969,d5824c3cf4ab,help them learn about a new topic they never researched before.
9970,45d091cfb477,"Students are busy in the Summer, witch is why a teacher- designed projects are better for them."
9971,45d091cfb477,"It may be summer break, but most students get jobs or go on vacation with their family, this is where a teacher designed project is better."
9972,45d091cfb477,If all the Student has to do is follow the teachers outline instead of coming up with ways to make a unique project on a topic they have never learned of before.
9973,45d091cfb477,"The ideal summer project is also not one that is supposed to be tedious, but one that will help student gain the basic knowledge needed for the class."
9974,45d091cfb477,Not a super stressful project that is left for the students to do with no outline or help from the teacher.
9975,45d091cfb477,I think because this is the first time the students are learning about this topic it is better if the teacher makes a template for the students to follow so they do the correct research.
9976,45d091cfb477,It will also take the stress of their chest so they can enjoy a nice summer break but learn at the same time.
9977,a2d33bb6ea99,"Researching a topic you never learned of before is a hard task, especially in the summer witch is why summer projects should be teacher- designed."
9978,66f82ba3cfc8,"When learning about a new subject it is better if someone is there to help you, instead of jumping into a project."
9979,66f82ba3cfc8,"Then you have to do a lot more research and it may not all be correct, and you wont be able to tell because this is your first time learning about the topic."
9980,66f82ba3cfc8,If a teacher was there help guide you through the project it will make the research easier and more reliable.
9981,66f82ba3cfc8,Another benefit is that Students will focus more on the learning part of the project more because they dont have to make their own with the little to no information they know about the topic.
9982,66f82ba3cfc8,"I feel the like a whole student- designed project is too stressful for them to do in the summer, because they lack the knowledge and discipline, so if it was teacher orientated it is a guarantee that the students will learn the correct criteria."
9983,66f82ba3cfc8,A teacher- designed project is more beneficial to the kids rather than a student- designed.
9984,bba9f7561fa2,"Not everyone agrees with me, some people will say that a student designed project is more beneficial for the kids."
9985,bba9f7561fa2,"They will argue, and say its summer the students should do their own project and do it in their own time."
9986,e746afab5849,"That wouldnt work because they dont know anything about the topic, and they will procrastinate and do it the last week of the summer making it rushed and it wont be beneficial to them at all."
9987,7c8ee145975f,They might also argue that students dont want to be pestered about how teacher want the work to be and it is a time for a little freedom and they can do a fun project that they deigned all by them self.
9988,0c5eb6ca4881,"Pushing creativity is good for students, but in I feel like a summer project is something you do so you can have knowledge of the topic when school starts, instead of something fun youll forget about in a week or two"
9989,b61bf8b30c03,There are arguments for student based projects but in the end my opinion will still stand that a teacher- designed project is more beneficial for the students.
9990,b61bf8b30c03,"I feel like teacher- designed projects are the best for students for two reasons, It will make it easier on the students to learn about a new topic they never learned of before, and its easier for them in the summer."
9991,b61bf8b30c03,"Some may feel that this isnt best and a student- designed project is more beneficial, but in the end my opinion will remain the same and that is, that teacher-designed projects are the way to go."
9992,2c44e1c4ef96,In this story the author is talking about Venus.
9993,2c44e1c4ef96,Alot of people could care less about the planets but its a big part of the world today.
9994,2c44e1c4ef96,In this story its talking about Venus and everything people need too know about it
9995,c12bcfc147e2,I think the author in this passage described Venus well.
9996,671d14ed54e6,"He/she explained everything about Venus, The size, were its located, how hot it is etc."
9997,671d14ed54e6,"I think this cause in passage 1,2,3 it gives alot of information on Venus."
9998,671d14ed54e6,And the author organized the facts really well by putting alot of facts in each paragraph and focusing on that and giving alot of information on that subject.
9999,671d14ed54e6,In paragraph 4 it talks about how Venus is almost like the earth and how maybe one day they would like too visit.
10000,671d14ed54e6,This is a huge thing cause if so we could have another planet of life
10001,fddf32c0a06b,So in conclusion i think this article was very well planned and had just the right amount of infomation for a average person too learn and know about.
10002,a77694304095,"In this essay you will see reasons for the people who think it was created by aliens, and the people who think that it was not created by aliens."
10003,a77694304095,You will also see textual evidence for those reasons that we have.
10004,a77694304095,"In this article we will be talking about "" The Face on Mars""."
10005,a77694304095,So here our the reasons for us to think it was created by aliens and for it not to be created by aliens.
10006,77b53f7448b4,I believe that the face n mars was not created by aliens.
10007,5e690539c9df,"I believe that because of how the ""face"" has evolved."
10008,87d1172c4d5b,In 1976 the face looked like a face.
10009,87d1172c4d5b,In 1998 it started to not look like a face at all.
10010,87d1172c4d5b,In 2001 it just looked like a rock.
10011,87d1172c4d5b,So i believe that it was not created by aliens but that it was just something the olanet had made itself.
10012,87d1172c4d5b,This has certainly got the attention of the people.
10013,87d1172c4d5b,"The ""Face on Mars"" is not a face."
10014,87d1172c4d5b,"If you look at the pictures from 1976, and 1998, and 2001 and in the text it says that the photo from 2001 is the most recent photo that NASA has."
10015,87d1172c4d5b,It still looks nothing like a face so since the 2001 picture is the most recent it shows that it is just a natural landform.
10016,87d1172c4d5b,It is just a natural landform.
10017,87d1172c4d5b,On Mars there are natural landforms everywhere and the fade away.
10018,87d1172c4d5b,Here on earth natural landforms are created everyday.
10019,b1d43d7e35f7,"This article it also states that the ""Face on Mars"" is really just a mesa"
10020,c0883f9424cd,"Which proves that the so called ""face"" is not a face and it is just a landform."
10021,58069969fa24,Others still thought it was a face.
10022,58069969fa24,Those people thought that because of what the article says in parargraph 11.
10023,3679dd852891,"In paragraph 11 it states that "" As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, so if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground, Egyptian-style pyramids, or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"""
10024,3679dd852891,So because of what they had said in that paragraph people believed that they had saw a face.
10025,0eb91448cb6b,"Those are the reasons for why people had thought that the ""Face on Mars"" was an actual face."
10026,0eb91448cb6b,Also the reasons why people thought that it was just a natural landform instead.
10027,d6df96852d91,Have you ever been on a trip to cross the Alantic Ocean?

10045,69da163886dd,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author talks and describes to us this new technology that can detect how you feel and can tell you about your emotions just by looking at your facial traits."
10046,69da163886dd,"It identifies six basic emotions-hapiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness."
10047,2e07405c3426,This kind of a technology has many good and positive effects attached to it.
10048,5f58621accdc,This technology allows us to know how a person is feeling or allows us to know how a person was feeling when a picture was taken.
10049,f147fbf8c136,"For example,""She's 83 percent happy, 9 percent disgusted, 6 percent fearful, and 2 percent happy."""
10050,f147fbf8c136,"This evaluation of emotion is from the painting of Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo Da Vinci."
